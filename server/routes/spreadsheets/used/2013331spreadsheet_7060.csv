You'll find places where water has penetrated the structure where it should not have. Identifying mold and moisture is a much easier task with the Mµ Thermal Imager.,Mµ Optics is currently seeking financial support on crowsourced-funding website Indiegogo. The iPhone attachment may offer steep competition to the existing thermal imaging cameras that range in prices from $2000 to $22000 according to Mµ Optics. The Mµ Thermal Imager is currently offered for $125 and $150 to early adopters with a final price goal of less than $200 if they are able to stock the product in the big box stores.,http://bit.ly/WzfWWb, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,archinect,tech, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj1rzicyqM1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13w0hxU, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Citing the notoriously jolie-laide actress Béatrice Dalle as an inspiration Guillaume steered his muse slightly to the left to fascinating effect. The Carven building blocks were absolutely there: flirty skirts casual party dresses great solid coats. But Dalle's Lolita influence was everywhere from the slouchy bathrobe styling to the undressed allure of a pink slip dress paired with opera-length gloves. References aside Carven continues to get the proportions just right: Guillaume knows that girls like their sweaters cropped and their skirts high-waisted.

Now it is using the same formula to prefabricate its own programming to fit what it thinks we will like. Isn't the inevitable result of this that the creative impulse gets channeled into a pre-built canal?,Because tastes never change? We don't have any choice but to watch what is handed to us? Will creators stop making things that go against the norm? Leonard concludes with us stuck in a trance in front of our televisions.,The companies that figure out how to generate intelligence from that data will know more about us than we know ourselves and will be able to craft techniques that push us toward where they want us to go rather than where we would go by ourselves if left to our own devices. I'm guessing this will be good for Netflix's bottom line but at what point do we go from being happy subscribers to mindless puppets?,Again the assumption is that we have no say in the matter. But when a company or service suggests that we buy or watch something we don't have to follow.,Netflix in particular thrives by providing a service that shows us what we think we might want to watch from a selection of thousands of options. Part of that algorithm depends on our own movie ratings and preferences. If Netflix offers poor suggestions you can leave the service. Yeah. You can stop paying 8 bucks a month.,Let's turn it around. What if Netflix analyzed viewing data not to offer their best viewing suggestions or to make shows and movies that people like but to expand people's viewing windows? Let's say that the data shows that you watch a lot of "witty critically acclaimed comedies" so Netflix suggests you watch more "romantic dramas" to make you more well-rounded. Are you a mindless puppet if you take the suggestion even if you end up hating the movie? Are you a mindless puppet if you ignore the suggestion and continue watching what you know you like?,From the production perspective it makes sense to try to make something a lot of people like. From the consumer perspective we still get to decide what we want to spend our money on.,It's good to be concerned about how companies use personal data. Data privacy ownership and ethics are important issues but it shouldn't mean a fear of all things data.,http://bit.ly/15t22dU, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,flowingdata,data,nathan yau,tv,tech, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj5b1xKiHp1s75lgto2_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WDPkTL, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

If you guessed Facebook you are way behind the eight-ball because Tumblr now enjoys more regular visits from the youth of America…,Tumblr actually became huge because it is the anti-blog. What is the No. 1 reason that people quit blogging? Because they can't find and develop an audience. This has been true of every blogging platform ever made. Conversely blogs that do find an audience tend to keep adding that type of content. This simple philosophy boils down to the equation: Mo' pageviews = mo' pages.,But Tumblr does not conform to this calculus and the reason is that a large percentage of Tumblr users actually don't WANT an audience. They do not want to be found except by a few close friends who they explicitly share one of their tumblogs with. Therefore Tumblr's notoriously weak search functionality is A-OK with most of its user base.,Tumblr provides its users with the oldest privacy-control strategy on the Internet: security through obscurity and multiple pseudonymity. Its users prefer a coarse-grained scheme they can easily understand over a sophisticated fine-grained privacy control - such as Facebook provides - that requires a lot of time and patience. To quote Sweet Brown Ain't nobody got time for that.,Tumblr proves that the issue is less about public vs. private and more about whether you are findable and identifiable by people who actually know you in real life…,the fact that Tumblr offers full animated gif support is crucial as a differentiator from the static environs of Facebook Twitter Instagram and even Pinterest. Ten seconds of reaction shot - or sex act - make a big difference in expressive power. Also gifs are far easier to view on mobile devices than video and so far the big content owners have made little effort to stamp them out via DMCA.,Does this sound familar? Teenagers amusing images sharing only with trusted friends? In some ways Tumblr is actually Facebook 2.0! As Facebook has become a real-life social network infested with parents co-workers ex-friends and people you barely know Tumblr has become the place where young people express themselves and their ACTUAL INTERESTS with their ACTUAL FRIENDS.,And Tumblr is growing - it's now one of the top 10 websites in the United States with 20 billion pageviews a month. The tremendous user engagement is enabling the company to quietly and discreetly build a powerful Interest Graph of things its users actually like and want to share. Tumblr still has a long road ahead with monetization but the Interest Graph will be crucial to making sure anything Tumblr does is targeted and relevant to its users.,It's important to note that Tumblr is not replacing Facebook; it's merely siphoning off some authentic liking and sharing especially among young Americans. Facebook needs to exist because it's holding down the Mom siblings and lame friends part of a person's social life - the "public-private" life if you will. As long as Mom sees you on Facebook occasionally she isn't going to think to look for you on another site… which paradoxically frees young users to act out on a stage that seems more private to them despite being on the open web., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,tumblr,facebook,privacy,sharing,youth,teenagers, , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I'm 31 so young enough to remember what it was like to be young but old enough to be out of touch with the youngest millenials and those even younger. To be honest it's a sobering notion that there's some piece of technology out there that you and your peer group doesn't use and doesn't understand. As far as I can tell it might be a first for me and my geezer friends. ,I kept turning it over in my head. I wanted to understand this phenomenon - if I didn't have an intuitive sense then I wanted to at least get more data. ,That's where YC startup Survata came in. With their help I surveyed 1038 people in two groups - those aged 13-18 (546 responses) and 19-25 (492 responses) and asked which services they used regularly (defined by several hours per week or more multiple answers OK). ,Here's the result:,,And the raw numbers:,,Survata cofounder Aaron Wenger noted: "Usage levels were higher among 13-18yr olds than 19-25yr olds for every social network.  The biggest differences were for Snapchat (13% for 13-18yr olds vs 4% for 19-25yr olds) and Instagram (21% vs 11%)." ,This confirms Josh's observation that there is some significant usage among the younger generation - particularly among high-school age teenagers. Whether they continue to use it as they mature get email addresses and enter the workforce will be an interesting thing to watch. ,It turns out Facebook's doing just fine with the kids these days - in fact slightly more of the younger demographic reported using it regularly. But perhaps most impressive was Tumblr topping the list at #1 with 59% of respondents saying they used it regularly. ,Survata showed my question as a content survey-wall to people throughout the United States - respondents were slightly female skewed (60% vs. 40% dudes) - and they appeared on blogs and content providers like Hyperink. I was impressed with how the data came back just overnight and how it ended up costing so little to get such useful data. ,Perhaps the most heartening observation from the Snapchat/Instagram phenomenon is that new social behaviors can and will happen. For a time the door may have seemed closed. Yet Flickr sprung out of nowhere in 2002 when nobody else believed in consumer web. Ten years later it might be deja vu all over again. ,If you're curious like I am and are wondering about how people think or use anything run your own Survata and share the results - real data from real people is like dietary fiber - we need more of it and more often.,You should follow me on twitter here. ,,(via Tenth Grade Tech Trends: My survey data says says rumors of Facebook demise exaggerated but Snapchat and Instagram real garry's posthaven), , , , , , , , ,tech,social media,data,sharing,youth,instagram,snapchat,tumblr,twitter,facebook, , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj6veqZnPJ1s75lgto1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:medium_Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_9.42.41_AM.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:medium_Screen_Shot_2013-01-08_at_1.45.22_AM.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This is instark contrast to what the people I follow on Instagram take photos of and very analogous to the photos that appear in my Facebook Newsfeed.,My takeaway: Facebook was smart to buy Instagram.,Facebook,She mentioned that she tries to visit Facebook as infrequently as possible. "It's addicting" she bemoaned "you end up getting lost in it and I don't like that." I found this perspective interesting. Facebook is clearly doing a good job delivering relevant content yet its users (at least this one) feel poorly when they use the service. Related she mentioned that she only visits Facebook after her Instagram Feed updates have been exhausted.,My takeaway: Facebook may have an irreversibly bad brand.,Instant Message,"When you go on Facebook Chat the people you don't want to talk to are always the ones who immediately chat with you.",Most of my sister's friends' post-school communication takes place on iOS apps such as iMessage and Snapchat.,My takeaway: I wonder if a Facebook email product could take a significant share of the market from Gmail and Yahoo once my sister's demographic reaches college (where almost all of my social and academic communication was via email).,Snapchat,My sister maintains that Snapchat is up there with Instagram in terms of usage amongst her peers. Her exemplary use case was a moment that she captured in the airport of a funny looking man who was snoozing in an awkward position. It's the type of thing that you want to share with somebody but it's insignificance would make it awkward in a text or status update. "It's a way to connect with friends when you don't really have anything to say." Or in my words if traditional messaging is functional - communicating for a purpose; "What time do you want to meet for the movie?" - Snapchat is the opposite whatever that is.,My takeaway: Snapchat is a communication tool seriously.,Tumblr,…despite knowing many active Tumblr users she said she didn't know anyone who actually posted on the service. Rather she said the majority of her friends merely consumed content with a tiny minority reblogging stuff that reflected who they wanted to be.,Third she said most of her friends stopped using the service once they reached high school: "Tumblr is mostly middle schoolers. Especially hipsters. They just reblog stuff.",Finally whereas Instagram is a place you follow "celebrities and bands" she mentioned that on Tumblr her friends follow people who they aspire to be. Cobra Snake was her quintessential example of the type of Tumblr user that is idolized on the service. These "idols" are the ones who post most of the content (photos) on Tumblr content that is then reblogged by kids who aspire to be what the photos represent.,My takeaway: I can't get over the "middle schoolers use it" comment especially since they use Tumblr as an identity tool. That's exactly how my friends and I used Myspace in middle school and we too abandoned it (for Facebook) once we reached high school. So in middle school you care a lot about your personal presentation (themes and cultural images on your Myspace or Tumblr page) but once you reach high school you care more about the people you present yourself with (photos on Facebook and Instagram)? Maybe I'm reading into this too much. Maybe not.,Twitter,"Nobody uses it. I know you love it but I don't get it. I mean I guess a a few kids use it but they're all the ones who won't shut up in class who always think they have something important to say.", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,social media,youth,sharing, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:0*AG53JIgZ_yFfG_5L.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But your average 20-something he is not. Some would describe the 24-year-old as the definitive photographer of hipster culture worldwide.,Getting his start as an assistant to Shepard Fairey the young photographer quickly became immersed in the creative worlds of haute couture and club kids. He has met partied with and photographed celebrities. Now he works alongside them and considers many of them his friends.,On his website where he sells his photos and clothing he has posted a tribute to DJ AM - with photos of the deejay smiling working and hanging out. And although he's quiet about the topic of Adam Goldstein he dishes about just about anything else - except how much he earns from taking photographs of other people. Hunter chatted with us about his dream life what he's wearing and what's next:,,When's your birthday? July 21 1985 Your sign?I'm on the cusp but I'm a Cancer. You're very young and yet you've achieved a lot. Do you already feel as if you've seen and done it all?No way. I'm just beginning. I've got so many other cool things I'm trying and working on. I'm really excited about life.Can you talk about those cool things you're working on?One is that I'm working with RVCA [the surf and skateboard line] and we're doing a collection with pieces of clothing that I designed. What kind of clothes? Men's? Women's?Fun button-ups crazy jeans. It's good for everyone. It's wild and crazy like me. Speaking of clothes it's been said that you dress badly and that you will wear absolutely anything. Why is that?I'm so aware of fashion and trends. I've photographed New York Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week and other fashion-type things. I digest all that and I just do whatever I want. Is there anything you wouldn't wear?No. I find irony in everything. I've worn Ed Hardy on occasion. It was my Halloween costume. I wear Crocs out. I get made fun of for that. What are you wearing right now?Right now I'm about to go to Hurricane Harbor or Raging Waters - whichever one has better coupons. So I'm getting my beach look on. I'm pretty sure you are doing fairly well financially. You still use coupons?I love coupons. What are your dreams?To continue to be creative and sort of push the boundaries. This whole thing has been ridiculous for me. I got into meetings with big corporate companies and I'm on the agenda as "Cobra Snake." It's crazy.,Cory Kennedy. You helped her get her start. What made her stand out among models/subjects?She has amazing personal style - mixing things you would never think could work and she makes them look great. Along with her carefree personality. She is a very magical person. And what about your beginnings. How did you get started in your business?I was working for Shepard Fairey for a couple of years as his assistant. He was introducing me to a lot of cool parties and art events. Events where Bjork would be deejaying and things like that. I recognized that this is special so I would take pictures. People would say things to me like "Hey I didn't bring my digital camera tonight. Can you e-mail me some pictures you took?" So I would e-mail the photos. Eventually I set up a website called Polaroid Scene. What kind of camera do you use?I never talk about my camera. Everyone has been trying to rip me off. Do you have a work routine? Things you do to get yourself ready?It's hard because I'm preparing myself for many different climates and I never know what I'm getting myself into. I'll do a keys wallet cellphone check. Camera extra batteries. Favorite drink?Beer. Do you have a favorite night club?Not really. Cinespace in Hollywood. Talk about club culture. How has it changed since you've been photographing it?It continues to evolve. Kids are finding the same music off blogs. Kids in Australia can listen to the same music they do here in L.A. because of the Internet. It's a crazy international party scene. You're from L.A. Like many photographers and other creative artists did you ever do the bi-coastal thing splitting time between here and New York?Yeah I shared an apartment with Steve Aoki in New York for about two years. For a while I focused a lot of energy on building a fan base in New York. Now it's more international cities. You're all over the world now. What's your favorite city?I like Sydney. I like Paris. I like Tokyo. It's so hard for me to pick. I've gone to Argentina with Toms Shoes and did a shoe drop. Giving shoes to those who don't have them. It's not always about partying. Do you photograph bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs?Yes. Also weddings and birthday parties and Sweet 16s. How many assistants do you have? I have an amazing team of about 10 people that help me with everything. From running the Cobra Shop my online store to helping with photo shoots art shows and castings. We also go on team hikes and bike rides., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashion,tech,youth,hipster, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj6w5pxfUM1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5990b61970c-320wi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5422d02970b-320wi, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Just ask Microsoft,Nothing lasts forever: if history has any lesson for us it is this. It's a thought that comes from rereading Paul Kennedy's magisterial tomeThe Rise and Fall of the Great Powers in which he shows that none of the great nation-states or empires of history – Rome; imperial Spain in 1600; France in either its Bourbon or Bonapartist manifestations; the Dutch republic in 1700; Britain in its imperial glory – succeeded in maintaining its global ascendancy for long.,What has this got to do with technology? Well it provides us with a useful way of thinking about two of the tech world's great powers. The first is Apple. The past week saw a veritable torrent of hysterical reaction to its quarterly results coupled with fevered speculation about its future. The globe has been hypnotised for years by Apple's metamorphosis from a failing computer manufacturer into a corporate giant that on some days is now the most valuable company in the world with bigger cash reserves than the annual GDP of some countries. But as with all inexorable growth curves the question on every commentator's lips is: has Apple peaked?,If you think "hysterical" is a bit harsh then ponder this. Although Apple did not sell the 50m iPhones that had been forecast for the quarter (it "only" shifted 47.8m) and sales of its Mac computers were down somewhat nevertheless the quarterly results mean that in 2012 Apple earned more in the year than any other corporation ever. And even the quarter's supposedly disappointing earnings of $13.1bn were the fourth largest of all time according to the same metric. And the reaction of the stock market to this news? The share price dropped 10% in after-hours trading.,Then there's the social network Facebook with its billion users which is likewise the focus of much hyperventilating comment. Recently the Mark Zuckerberg empire launched its latest deadly weapon with the catchy name of Graph Search – as in "social graph". Facebook's new tool is just an algorithm that finds information from within one's network of friends and supplements the results with hits from Microsoft's Bing search engine but to read some of the commentary on it you'd think that Zuckerberg & co had invented either a perpetual motion machine or a through-ticket to hell.,"Facebook's new search engine attempts to build walls around theinternet and keep its horde within its gates" wrote the webmaster of arespected online magazine. "It's a nightmare and it will probably work.",Actually it's Facebook's latest attempt to become the AOL de nos jours. And in the end it will fail for the same reason that AOL's attempt to corral users within its walled garden failed: the wider internet is just too diverse innovative and interesting. But because Facebook looms so large in the public consciousness at the moment it's difficult to keep it in perspective. Which is why Kennedy's book makes such salutary reading.,So what we need to remember as we wade through the current overheated commentary on Apple and Facebook is that nothing lasts forever. I have been in this racket long enough to remember a time when Microsoft was at least as dominant and scary as these two companies are now. Spool forward a couple of decades and Microsoft is still around but actually it's an ailing giant – profitable but no longer innovative trying (and so far failing) to get a foothold in the post-PC mobile cloud-based world.,Although the eclipsing of Apple and Facebook is inevitable the timing and causes of their eventual declines will differ. Apple's current strength is that it actually makes things that people are desperate to buy and on which the company makes huge margins. The inexorable logic of the hardware business is that those margins will decline as the competition increases so Apple will become less profitable over the longer term. What will determine its future is whether it can come up with new market-creating products such as the iPod iPhone and iPad.,Facebook on the other hand makes nothing. It just provides an online service that for the moment people seem to value. But in order to make money out of those users and satisfy the denizens of Wall Street it has to become ever more intrusive and manipulative. It's condemned in other words to intrusive overstretch. Which is why in the end it will become a footnote in the history of the internet. Just like Microsoft in fact. Sic transit gloria.,(via Why the Facebook and Apple empires are bound to fall | Technology | The Observer), , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,apple,facebook,business,forecast, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj6wboPnyp1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This interdisciplinary project conducted by architectural and engineering researchers of both institutes together with students of the faculty and in collaboration with biologists of the University of Tübingen investigates the possible interrelation between biomimetic design strategies and novel processes of robotic production. The research focused on the material and morphological principles of arthropods' exoskeletons as a source of exploration for a new composite construction paradigm in architecture.,At the core of the project is the development of an innovative robotic fabrication process within the context of the building industry based on filament winding of carbon and glass fibres and the related computational design tools and simulation methods. A key aspect of the project was to transfer the fibrous morphology of the biological role model to fibre-reinforced composite materials the anisotropy of which was integrated from the start into the computer-based design and simulation processes thus leading to new tectonic possibilities in architecture. The integration of the form generation methods the computational simulations and robotic manufacturing specifically allowed the development of a high performance structure: the pavilion requires only a shell thickness of four millimetres of composite laminate while spanning eight metres.,Following a "bottom-up" approach a wide range of different subtypes of invertebrates were initially investigated in regards to the material anisotropy and functional morphology of arthropods. The observed biological principles were analysed and abstracted in order to be subsequently transferred into viable design principles for architectural applications. The exoskeleton of the lobster (Homarus americanus) was analysed in greater detail for its local material differentiation which finally served as the biological role model of the project.,The lobster's exoskeleton (the cuticle) consists of a soft part the endocuticle and a relatively hard layer the exocuticle. The cuticle is a secretion product in which chitin fibrils are embedded in a protein matrix. The specific differentiation of the position and orientation of the fibres and related material properties respond to specific local requirements. The chitin fibres are incorporated in the matrix by forming individual unidirectional layers. In the areas where a non-directional load transfer is required such individual layers are laminated together in a spiral (helicoidal) arrangement. The resulting isotropic fibre structure allows a uniform load distribution in every direction. On the other hand areas which are subject to directional stress distributions exhibit a unidirectional layer structure displaying an anisotropic fibre assembly which is optimized for a directed load transfer. Due to this local material differentiation the shell creates a highly adapted and efficient structure. The abstracted morphological principles of locally adapted fibre orientation constitute the basis for the computational form generation material design and manufacturing process of the pavilion.,In collaboration with the biologists the fibre orientation fibre arrangement and associated layer thickness and stiffness gradients in the exoskeleton of the lobster were carefully investigated. The high efficiency and functional variation of the cuticle is due to a specific combination of exoskeletal form fibre orientation and matrix. These principles were applied to the design of a robotically fabricated shell structure based on a fibre composite system in which the resin-saturated glass and carbon fibres were continuously laid by a robot resulting in a compounded structure with custom fibre orientation.,In existing fibre placement techniques e.g. in the aero-space industry or advanced sail production the fibres are typically laid on a separately manufactured positive mold. Since the construction of a complete positive formwork is fairly unsuitable for the building industry the project aimed to reduce the positive form to a minimum. As a consequence the fibres were laid on a temporary lightweight linear steel frame with defined anchor points between which the fibres were tensioned. From the straight segments of the prestressed fibres surfaces emerge that result in the characteristic double curved shape of the pavilion. In this way the hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces resulting from the first sequence of glass fibre winding serve as an integral mould for the subsequent carbon and glass fibre layers with their specific structural purposes and load bearing properties. In other words the pavilion itself establishes the positive formwork as part of the robotic fabrication sequence. Moreover during the fabrication process it was possible to place the fibres so that their orientation is optimally aligned with the force flow in the skin of the pavilion. Fibre optic sensors which continuously monitor the stress and strain variations were also integrated in the structure. The project's concurrent consideration of shell geometry fibre arrangement and fabrication process leads to a novel synthesis of form material structure and performance.,Through this high level of integration the fundamental properties of biological structures were transferred:,- Heterogeneity: six different filament winding sequences control the variation of the fibre layering and the fibre orientation of the individual layers at each point of the shell. They are designed to minimize material consumption whilst maximizing the stiffness of the structure resulting in significant material efficiency and a very lightweight structure. - Hierarchy: the glass fibres are mainly used as a spatial partitioning element and serve as the formwork for the following layers whilst the stiffer carbon fibres contribute primarily to the load transfer and the global stiffness of the system. - Function integration: in addition to the structural carbon fibres for the load transfer and the glass fibres for the spatial articulation functional fibres for illumination and structural monitoring can be integrated in the system.,A prerequisite for the design development and realization of the project was a closed digital information chain linking the project's model finite element simulations material testing and robot control. Form finding material and structural design were directly integrated in the design process whereby the complex interaction of form material structure and fabrication technology could be used as an integral aspect of the biomimetic design methodology. The direct coupling of geometry and finite element simulations into computational models allowed the generation and comparative analysis of numerous variations. In parallel the mechanical properties of the fibre composites determined by material testing were included in the process of form generation and material optimization. The optimization of the fibre and layer arrangement through a gradient-based method allowed the development of a highly efficient structure with minimal use of material.,The robotic fabrication of the research pavilion was performed on-site in a purpose-built weatherproof manufacturing environment by a 6-axis robot coupled with an external seventh axis. Placed on a 2m high pedestal and reaching an overall working span and height of 4m the robot placed the fibres on the temporary steel frame which was actuated in a circular movement by the robotically controlled turntable. As part of the fabrication process the fibres were saturated with resin while running through a resin bath directly prior to the robotic placement. This specific setup made it possible to achieve a structure of approximately 8.0m in diameter and 3.5m height by continuously winding more than 60 kilometres of fibre rovings. The parametric definition of the winding motion paths in relation to the digital geometry model the robotic motion planning including mathematical coupling with the external axis as well as the generation of robot control code itself could be implemented in a custom-developed design and manufacturing integrated environment. After completion of the robotic filament winding process and the subsequent tempering of the fibre-resin composite the temporary steel frame could be disassembled and removed. The remaining extremely thin shell of just 4mm thickness constitutes an automatically fabricated but locally differentiated structure.,The concurrent integration of the biomimetic principles of the lobster's cuticle and the logics of the newly developed robotic carbon and glass fibre filament winding within the computational design process enable a high level of structural performance and novel tectonic opportunities for architecture. Despite its considerable size and span the semi-transparent skin of the pavilion weighs less than 320kg and reveals the system's structural logic through the spatial arrangement of the carbon and glass fibres. The synthesis of novel modes of computational and material design digital simulation and robotic fabrication allows both the exploration of a new repertoire of architectural possibilities and the development of extremely lightweight and materially efficient structures.,,ICD/ITKE Research Pavilion / University of Stuttgart Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning originally appeared on ArchDaily the most visited architecture website on 06 Mar 2013.,send to Twitter | Share on Facebook | What do you think about this?,http://bit.ly/10eNtLI, , , , , , , , ,architecture,material, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj8uuxdkbh1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:14teebW,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqemtn,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqemtp,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqejhk,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqejhm,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:XqejxC,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqemtt,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:XqejxE,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqemtv,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:XqejxI,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Xqemtz, , , , , , , , ,

Four years later when it had become apparent to him that "Qaddafi's departure is the only change that will work in Libya" Nye posthumously belittled his own role in Saif's PhD: "… at the request of a friend I read one chapter that referred to soft power something I have done for many who have written about that topic.

Ross wrote:,"I'm leaving because a Forbes writer asked his son's best friend Todd if Facebook was still cool and the friend said no and plus none of HIS friends think so either even Leila who used to love it and this journalism made me reconsider the long-term viability of the company.",A few sentences later Ross wrote "In all seriousness even after switching to part-time at Facebook it's just time for me to try new things" but the damage was done. Ross has since removed the letter perhaps because he'd accidentally posted it publicly or because his jesting intro wasn't taken as lightly as he'd hoped. The "journalism" Ross mentioned is hardly Pew Research but it means something. Facebook admitted in its annual 10-K report that it might be losing "younger users" to "other products and services similar to or as a substitute for Facebook." Teens are often an accurate barometer for what's cool and what's next and recent rumblings seem to indicate teens are moving on. Telling your colleagues that teens are no longer into your product is far from an Irish goodbye.,Teenspeak,When Branch co-founder Josh Miller asked his fifteen-year-old sister what was hot she said Facebook had gone cold. "She tries to visit Facebook as infrequently as possible" Miller wrote because it's addictive and because it's not as fun as Instagram. "Facebook may have an irreversibly bad brand" Miller concluded. But what if it's not about brand but about the changing definition of what's fun and addictive online? Perhaps more importantly the community on Facebook and the culture of the web is changing and privacy is starting to trump sharing for young users.,WHAT IF IT'S NOT ABOUT BRAND BUT ABOUT THE CHANGING DEFINITION OF WHAT'S FUN AND ADDICTIVE ONLINE?,"I think it has less to do with kids consciously looking for 'the next big thing' than Facebook just no longer being a space that serves them" says Laura Portwood-Stacer author of "Media Refusal and Conspicuous Non-Consumption: The Performative and Political Dimensions of Facebook Abstention". "I think kids are less self-conscious about trying to be cool than marketers would like to think" she said. When Facebook launched it was cool to expose details about yourself like what movies you like what you're doing right now and who you're in a relationship with. It was dare I say exhilarating - being able to share freely with the world without having to learn how to code or even how to apply a MySpace theme.,At some point adding these details like hundreds of photos from a recent vacation and status updates about your new job amounted to bragging - force-feeding Facebook friends information they didn't ask for. What was once cool was now uncool. Worse yet it started to feel like work. Maybe the burden of constantly constructing immaculate digital profiles of ourselves is tiring. "I find it boring and I don't really care about knowing all my friends' details anymore" my fifteen-year-old cousin Neah Bois wrote to me. "I think it's stupid when people post a lot of pictures about their lives and all that stuff… I go on to talk to family and connect but really I only go on once a week or so.",New apps new identities,Teens have turned to sites like Tumblr and apps like Snapchat and Instagram to communicate. "Tumblr is mainly my obsession as of now" says 15-year-old Collin Wisniewski. "It just seems more intimate and its not really a place of bragging but more of a place of sharing." "Does this sound familiar?" asks Adam Rifkin in a TechCrunch column. "Teenagers amusing images sharing only with trusted friends? In some ways Tumblr is actually Facebook 2.0!" he writes. Some data suggests that Tumblr may have already eclipsed Facebook as the most popular social network among 13-25 year-olds.,"[TUMBLR] JUST SEEMS MORE INTIMATE AND ITS NOT REALLY A PLACE OF BRAGGING BUT MORE OF A PLACE OF SHARING.",Part of Tumblr's success is no doubt due to that fact that it's a place where you can cultivate two or more identities whereas on Facebook you're stuck with just one: the real you. "It's a site where you can find people that are like you and you can feel less alone" Wisniewski said. Tumblr's simple and binary privacy controls may have also contributed to its success. "As Facebook has become a real-life social network infested with parents co-workers ex-friends and people you barely know" Rifkin writes "Tumblr has become the place where young people express themselves." Bois concurred. "I'm kind of obsessed. [Tumblr is] the new Facebook almost" she said.,On the mobile devices that have become so central to our lives "ephemeral" apps like Snapchat have emerged as a private way for friends to share photos. In the age of the dox - where a sense of online privacy is very sacred being able to communicate without leaving a permanent record is empowering. Whereas photos on Facebook last forever photos on Snapchat typically last about ten seconds. "I would say that this app really is one of my major communicating devices more than really a social network" Wisniewski says. "My sister maintains that Snapchat is up there with Instagram in terms of usage amongst her peers" Miller wrote.,Adapt to survive,Ultimately the day of the overshare may have passed and bragging online isn't as fun as it used to be. "I think that kids just don't care anymore" Bois wrote. "They have gotten over the idea of knowing everybody's life and everybody knowing their lives!" Fortunately for Facebook it has become adept at reshaping itself whenever a new tech trend emerges like peer-to-peer messaging. "Facebook has been particularly agile about following how people are using it and trying to anticipate what will keep people using it" Portwood-Stacer says. The company has sculpted its messaging platform into the most functional and useful cross-platform communication service which most teens admit that they use and has even added free calling to its Messenger app. Facebook is still on the way up as a pure communication utility. It has also taken steps to decrease the amount of Open Graph "spam" users receive in response to criticism.,"I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK FACEBOOK ITSELF IS STALE.","I don't actually think Facebook itself is stale" Portwood-Stacer says. "It's all about changing things up on you when they roll out some new feature… It is more socially stale if that makes sense." Today it's just not as cool to post pictures of yourself online no matter which social network you use - unless you're taking "selfies" ironically of course. "About 40 percent of everyday speech is devoted to telling others about what we feel or think" reported the Wall Street Journal back in May and online that figure could be much larger. While Facebook amplified our ability to share thoughts with others it also takes a hit when people realize the amount they're sharing through observing others. Mark Zuckerberg's baby is still a long ways off from the precipitous decline of Myspace but the data and the details gathered from teens show Facebook needs to be nimbler than ever to stay relevant to the next generation., , , , , , , ,tech,youth,facebook,sharing,tumblr, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj9202ZuCt1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Too Close to Call,Yesterday I published the first question of my driving direction survey showing an extremely fragmented market. It is a category led by Google but one that is fragmented and after a long period of calm is once again becoming heated.,Apple with the release of their own mapping product in September has quickly garnered market share and has created a playbook that others like Samsung could very well follow. After Apple's disastrous rollout where their mapping product was widely criticized (ah the problems of a market leader) life has settled in. I wanted to see 6 months in how Apple Maps was fairing in the competition for iPhone users and how many users were actively using products other than Apple's.,Using Google survey I created a filter question to ascertain their preferred device/software for driving directions. Five hundred users that indicated iPhone as the answer were asked this follow up question:,What mapping or driving directions app do you use most often on your iPhone?,The answer? Its a statistical dead heat with Google Maps for the iPhone showing a lead that is well within the margin of error of the survey.,What does this mean for Apple and Google?,The survey doesn't really address whether the users still using Apple Maps are happy or just victioms of inertia. My anecdotal reports would indicate the former that many are very happy with the product but I don't have hard data to back that up. Apple in releasing a product before it was fully ready opened themselves up to plenty of criticism. More importantly they have yet to learn how to play defense well in an all too combative market that will take any opportunity to go after the market leader.,Apple has a solid market share and more importantly critical real estate. They have a product that is easy to use and very attractive. They seem to be willing to do what it takes to make Apple Maps a long term contender.,Google a hyper competitive player will (or should I say has) move into their release often upgrade features till the other side gets tired strategy. Yesterday after only two months on the market they released a fairly significant upgrade to their iPhone Google Maps product.,As Googler Joel Headley noted on Google + yesterday in response to my survey:,It's great to see a number of players that have great apps. I know it will help focus Google to develop new and exciting things in mapping not thought of by other folks. ,Google not used to second place in the mapping space seems willing to invest resources in regular and frequent upgrades to their iPhone app (even while Their Places Product is burning).,Mapquest an early entrant into the iPhone driving directions market with an excellent product lost a tremendous opportunity to gain visibility both before the Apple Maps release and in its aftermath. I am not sure how they missed their chance. They too could have been a contender and one has to wonder exactly what they were thinking during the fiasco. The many bit players like the telco products will never achieve lift off velocity. Waze seems to have moved on with Apple's entry.,It does seem to be a two horse race. Like I said yesterday "driving directions long a stable and somewhat boring market is once again in play". The advent of mobile platforms has injected vitality and change into a market that needed just that.,Note: See yesterday's post for methodology and issues related to the survey results that might impact the results.,Related posts:,Driving Directions Survey- A Fragmented But Important Market,Mapquest Adds MapQuest 4 Mobile for iPhone,Nokia HERE Maps Sucks (Significantly) More Than Apple Maps,     ,http://bit.ly/XP8qsC, , , ,maps,tech,navigation, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj8vjzgxyX1s75lgto1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3HM1,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:hXKZTt,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:12tWpyd,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:12tWpyf,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:hl62kT,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:gOJhZ2,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:12tWq5l,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3I2w, , , , , , , , , , , ,

The prosthetic was constructed using an additive printing process and was implanted following manufacturer Oxford Performance Materials receiving FDA approval to use the technology last month. News.com.au reports that the company can create similar implants in two weeks after receiving 3D scans of a patient's injured area. It believes that 500 people in the US each month could take advantage of the new process. The implant is made of polyetherketoneketone a biocompatible polymer that won't interfere with X-rays. Small details are etched along the surface of the prosthetic to promote the growth of bone and cells. This is the first additively manufactured polymer implant to receive approval by the FDA. Reports on the new surgery are unclear on whether it was 75 percent of the skull's surface area or the skull's mass that was replaced however we believe that it's likely to be the latter. Because the implant doesn't have to be tooled and can be created directly from a digital file the company reports that there are few limits on what it can make.

The modular project concentrates on customizable space with the aim of not only to create various purposes of space but to reflect the theatre performing motion and spirit to the pavilion. Inspired by the dancing or performance motion captured in time the project's facade represents the abstract act and movement of the performance of the theatre. More images and architects' description after the break.,,The motion itself is created by series of mountain climbing ropes installation weaved together forming a facade. The illusion of the elegant abstract movement is a result of the way of weaving the ropes between top and bottom fixing then the intersection of the weaving will travel as you move.,The rounded shape of WIT pavilion provides a unique experience of a timeless journey and also on the other side it gives a certain transparency from direct visual angle and helps to reinforce the motion at other angle. Beside the ropes featuring as a facade from a distance it also allows a certain level of transparency towards to the exhibition space as people walks closer to the pavilion. It leaves a curiosity behind the emotional movement.,Capturing motion in time is a dynamic language of abstract movement and pattern. This language is introduced on the geometry and also the facade system in order to give sense of fluidity continuity and lightness. Like a dance it is performed in many cultures as a form of emotional expression social interaction or exercise in a spiritual or performance setting and is sometimes used to express ideas or tell a story. It lies an emotion behind the movement which is re-interpreted by a method of weaving.,Weaving is a method of fabric production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. A fabric is made to cover or protect your body and it has to be soft to the skin. Besides that it needs certain porosity for air ventilation to your body. The blend of inter-relationship between the motion and the softness of weaving creates a emotional tension which creates a level of dynamic movement through a visual illusion.,Architects: Meta- Studio Location: Warsaw Poland Project Team: Jaenes Bong Jonathan Alotto Area: 156m2 Status: Operalab Competition Entry Year: 2012 ,         ,Weaving In-Tension (WIT) Pavilion: Operalab Competition Entry / Meta- Studio originally appeared on ArchDaily the most visited architecture website on 09 Mar 2013.,send to Twitter | Share on Facebook | What do you think about this?,http://bit.ly/13NFaYo, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,archdaily,architecture,alison furuto, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjes29Kj7i1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaVHZ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaVI1,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXjc,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXje,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXjg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXzu,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaVI5,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaVI7,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXzw,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXzy,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaYDz,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaXzA,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaYDB,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WTaYDD, , , , , ,

In true Hadid-fashion the Changsha Meixihu International Culture & Arts Center defines itself by extreme sinuous curves that radiate from each of the three independent structures and links them to a pedestrianized landscape that offers a "strong urban experience" forming what they hope to be a global destination for theater and art.,More on the cultural and arts center after the break…,,The International Culture & Arts Centre embodies a unique variety of civic nodes and spaces: A Grand Theatre a Contemporary Art Museum a Multipurpose Hall and supporting facilities. The central plaza is generated by the relative position of these separate buildings and offers a strong urban experience whereby the flow of pedestrian visitors that come from all sides of the site intersect and meet. In parallel it also stretches outwards to the neighboring streets with unfettered and phenomenal views across Meixi lake with access towards Festival Island.,The Grand Theatre is the focal point of the Changsha International Culture & Arts Centre. It is the largest performance venue in the city with a total capacity of 1800 seats. Designed to host world-standard performances the building contains will contain all the necessary front of house functions such as lobbies cloakrooms bars restaurants and VIP hospitality as well as the required ancillary functions such as administration rehearsal rooms backstage logistics dressing and make-up rooms and wardrobe.,The Museum's composition of three fluid petals around its internal central atrium juxtaposes of the various patchworks of gallery spaces in a truly seamless fashion. With outward views and balconies to its exteriors it aims to engage the site's unique location and surrounding views into some of its gallery spaces. An external plaza which faces Meixi Lake Road allows for outdoor sculptures exhibitions and events to be extended to an expansive outdoor space.,The Small Theatre (Multipurpose Hall) is characterized by its flexibility. With a maximum capacity of 500 seats it can be adapted and transformed to different configurations. It can therefore accommodate a broad range of functions and shows that span from banquets and commercial events to small plays fashion shows and music. A commercial attraction this venue shares seamless public access to retail areas and restaurant facilities which are seated in an open and gently sunken courtyard linking visitors to and from the basement level.,Although these civic institutions are uniquely defined and separate they supply each other in all respects within its setting with plazas offering visitors a tapestry-like sequence of urban ambiances that relate to the different institutions inject the site with urban vitality. The working hours of the different venues also overlap to ensure continuity during the full 24 hour cycle; Operated during the evening the Grand Theatre becomes active as the Museum begins to conclude its day- time operations whilst the Small theatre and retail/restaurants would be commercially available day and night. In this regard they benefit from each other's vicinity ensuring that the site is lively 24 hours a day. This dynamic composition further establishes a powerful relationship with its surroundings which confers monumentality to the ensemble.,Embodying values of functionality elegance and innovation the Changsha Meixi Lake International Culture & Arts Center aims to become the new cultural and civic node for the city of Changsha and well as global cultural destination.,Click here to view the embedded video.,Architects: Zaha Hadid Architects Design: Zaha Hadid Patrik Schumacher Project Director: Woody Yao Simon Yu Project Leader : Simon Yu Project Team: Zhenjiang Guo Charles Kwan Jinqi Huang Neil Sansom Pravin Ghosh Thomas Jensen Justin Kelly Wandy Mulia Uli Schifferdecker Adrian Aguirre Herrera Aurora Santana Koren Sin Johanna Huang Yifan Zhang Collin Spelts Fei Liang Adam Fingrut Yitzhak Samun Schematic Design : Zhenjiang Guo Charles Kwan Jinqi Huang Museum Design: Tariq Khayyat Kutbuddin Nadiadi Diego Rossel Gerry Cruz Matteo Melioli Xiaosheng Li Yuxi Fu Thomas Jensen Matthew Johnson Justin Kelly Drew Merkle Structural Facade & Building Services Engineering: Buro Happold Theater Consultants: Theatre Projects Consultants Acoustics Consultants: Marshall Day Acoustics Competition Team: Tiago Correia (Project Architect); Victor Orive Fabiano Continanza Zhenjiang Guo Danilo Arsic Ines Fontoura Rafael González Alejandro Diaz Jimena Araiza (Project Team); Hannes Schafelner Philipp Ostermaier Jakub Klaska Maren Klasing Saman Saffarian Martin Krcha Maria Tsironi Spyridon Kaprinis (Concept Development) Area: 0.0 sqm Year: 0 Photographs: Courtesy of Zaha Hadid Architects,      ,Changsha Meixihu International Culture & Art Centre / Zaha Hadid Architects originally appeared on ArchDaily the most visited architecture website on 09 Mar 2013.,send to Twitter | Share on Facebook | What do you think about this?,http://bit.ly/Y0DbvL, , , , , , , , , ,archdaily,architecture,karissa rosenfield, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjes2eGngr1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbeY,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NF9DK,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbf0,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbf2,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NF9DM,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NF9DQ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbvi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbvk,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbvm,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NF9DT,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NFbvo,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13NF9DV, , , , , , , ,

The social and economic landscape of the early '90s was a cultural turning point both nationally and globally. Conflict in Europe attempts at peace in the Middle East the AIDS crisis national debates on health care gun control and gay rights and caustic partisan politics were both the background and source material for a number of younger artists who first came to prominence in 1993. This exhibition brings together a range of iconic and lesser-known artworks that serve as both artifacts from a pivotal moment in the New York art world and as key markers in the cultural history of the city. "NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star" draws its subtitle from the eponymous album that the New York rock band Sonic Youth recorded in 1993 and captures the complex exchange between mainstream and underground culture across disciplines which came to define the art of the era. The exhibition takes a broad view of the New York scene as it existed twenty years ago-focusing not only on a single generation of emerging New York artists but also looking at more senior figures and individuals from other cities who had some of their first significant exhibitions in New York in 1993. Works that are immediately recognizable from major institutional presentations like the Whitney Biennial and Venice Biennale are presented alongside lesser-known works which may have initially only been seen by a small audience in commercial galleries alternative spaces or in the artist's studio. This exhibition is not a definitive history of the art in the 1990s nor is it one that privileges a single group of artists united under a single thematic or conceptual banner. Instead the exhibition takes the form of a kind of vertical cross section of artistic production in New York City-capturing both the familiar and the forgotten and bringing together individuals who may have originally inhabited radically different positions. The critical debates and discussions of the early 1990s-on issues such as racial and gender politics globalism and institutional critique-have been taken up again in recent years by younger artists writers activists and filmmakers demonstrating how our current social and political moment grows out of the events and ideas of the recent past. Many of the artists in the exhibition have only recently become prominent and although others may seem less familiar to a contemporary audience all the participants have contributed to the complex intersection between art and the world at large that defined the 1990s and continues to shape artistic expression today. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with key historical texts and reflections by younger curators and writers on the impact of this pivotal moment in American culture.

Or as James Truman then-editor of Details magazine said in 1992 "It's unfashion. …Grunge is about not making a statement which is why it's crazy for it to become a fashion statement.…Buying grunge from Seventh Avenue is ludicrous.",So grunge wasn't fashion but it was undeniably a style one that was spawned in and around Seattle before the logging and fishing industries were decimated from the days when it was common to see flannel-clad lumberjacks and crabbers putting a dent in their fat paychecks at the dive bars where Bed Bath & Beyond and Abercrombie & Fitch stores now stand. The warm layered and inexpensive style that suited the Northwest working-class was adopted by the flood of musicians drifting into town. Even the growing tribe of nerds that used funny words like "high tech" and "dot-com" dropped cash on comfy fleece wool and Goretex at outdoor outfitters like Filson Pendleton and REI. By the early 1990s Seattle was quite probably the worst dressed town with the best music scene in the world. And then on this day in 1992 during New York Fashion Week Perry Ellis designer Marc Jacobs introduced his now-notorious Spring '93 grunge-inspired collection and turned a no-nonsense efficient style of dressing into a national joke.,On one hand Jacobs nailed the look. Midriffs were bare dresses were baggy and printed with granny flowers flannel shirts were tied around waists and combat boots fit every foot. Except Jacobs' "flannel" shirts were in fact sand-washed silk and his "polyester" dresses were diaphanous chiffons. Three-figure price tags were slapped on clothes that intentionally tried to look polyester.,Paying homage to pop culture is nothing new in the fashion world. Details editor Truman's "ludicrous" remark comes into play though when you figure in that this all occurred during the height of a recession when the average Seattle barista had a Masters degree andbought thermal undershirts second hand at Goodwill. To boot grunge culture was also at its peak and there was no shortage of authentic flannel to be had for a song. Ludicrous indeed.,Fashion critic Bernadine Morris described Jacobs' collection as "mixing everything up. …A typical outfit looks as if it were put together with the eyes closed in a very dark room." But she was quick to applaud his smart choice of decidedly anti-grunge fabrics ones that had "no air of the ashcan hovering over them." It was one thing to look like a poverty-stricken teenage musician and quite another to feel-or smell-like one.,The following day of Fashion Week Anna Sui introduced her own homage to grunge although her take was a bit more flower-child hippie and young designer Christian Francis Roth sent out an even more gentrified version with ultra-soft leggings peeking out from shirts gently tied around waists.,Jacobs who admitted to never having been to Seattle triumphed in the grunge trifecta not because his collection was the best but because Women's Wear Daily hailed him the "guru of grunge." Back in Seattle the same musicians and hangers-on who inspired the look collectively threw up in their pitchers of beer (probably necessary disclaimer time: I moved to Seattle in 1992 at age 21 and was definitely in the eye-rolling crowd). To them (us) most of whom struggled to make ends meet the capitalization of a thrift-store style was about as classy as championing "homeless chic" or fashion inspired by a devastating natural disaster. And sure there was the personal indignation that occurs whenever an outsider "discovers" something low-end and exploits it into something saccharine and inauthentic. Still the rockers weren't alone: Word of the grunge collections spread overnight with newscasters collapsing into giggles over collections that seemed like a real-life enactments of Qui Êtes-Vous Polly Maggoo?. From a public relations perspective the fashion world couldn't have seemed more out of touch. (To put it in perspective imagine a young designer today say Christian Siriano creating his next collection based on Twilight.),Yet the following February Jacobs got a standing O when he received the CFDA Designer of the Year Award as presented by Christy Turlington while Linda Evangelista handed the Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent to Anna Sui. Galvanized Jacobs announced a week later that he was leaving Perry Ellis and launching his own label one that would be underwritten by his former employer. What he didn't mention is that the grunge collections didn't sell. In late February the New York Times reported "Though [Jacobs] had delivered a much-discussed and much-photographed grunge-inspired collection for spring the board of Perry Ellis International did not foresee ever making money on his women's wear… and decided to stop producing the unprofitable women's collection that Mr. Jacobs had been designing for four years [since founder Perry Ellis' death from AIDS].",Walter Thomas then the creative director at J.Crew nailed it when he said "By the time you see [a trend] in Kmart it can be three years [after it first hit the catwalk]. The difference with grunge is that it was already for sale at Kmart not to mention the Salvation Army." So of course no one bought Seventh Avenue grunge when the real thing could be had for a song.,A year later Kurt Cobain died. The recession lifted and an economic boom took place. Thrifting was no longer a necessity. Seattle was seen as passé and the fashion world sniggered over the dreadful era of grunge and hoped everyone would forget about it.,Then a few years ago a change in attitude occurred. Fashion blogs primarily helmed by women in their early 20s began digging back into history and took a hankering to the styles of the late 1980s and early 90s. The work of Anna Sui and poor Christopher Francis Roth rarely get a nod but Marc Jacobs' collection is hailed as genius. And admittedly even strangely today Jacobs' clothes look like a fresh take on an old classic. Perhaps he should have waited a few years to commemorate a culture that was not yet out of style. -Ali BasyePhotos: Top second to the bottom and bottom are by Steven Meisel for Vogue December 1992.

The event was staged in the ruins of Linlithgow Palace near Edinburgh in Scotland. SEE THE FULL SHOW PICTURES HERE "Karl's interpretation of traditional Scottish dress was exquisite and imaginative and to say the setting was magical is a huge understatement" she told us this morning. "It was one of those evenings where you just felt so privileged to be there." Unsurprisingly tartan and tweed were key themes - as worn by Cara Delevingne Stella Tennant and Edie Campbell on a catwalk that encircled medieval-inspired baskets of fire. Guests sat underneath a wooden awning as the show took place with refreshments in the form of hot ginger and whiskey to help ensure no one felt the snowy weather. Afterwards an exclusive dinner was held overlooking a nearby loch - at which six bagpipers provided the evening's soundtrack before British musician Jake Bugg performed. The luxury fashion house has had a long-standing love for Scotland. Coco Chanel had always used Scottish wool in her creations but her fascination with the country was heightened when she started a romantic relationship with the Duke of Westminster in 1924. The pair would often visit his numerous estates in the Scottish Highlands occasionally joined by Winston Churchill. The tweed jackets and Fairisle jumpers that the Duke wore to go hunting and fishing during these breaks inspired the designer's work for years to come.

Among the current addictions is a nihilistic vision of beauty that mirrors the wasted silhouettes and pinched faces of drug addicts.,This explains why Bob Dole recently jumped on the fashion world for sending "a false and deadly message to America's youth that drugs are harmless fun.",Magazine readers have seen this gloomy look in the dark-rimmed vacant eyes of models.

He's not one to keep quiet about such things.) ,Fashion critics no matter how much they personally enjoy or despise a collection are tasked with making educated guesses and comments about what exactly the designer is trying to convey. That way they can still put a positive spin on clothes they find ugly. In the case of this collection no one seems to know what exactly Slimane was getting at besides a very expensive redux of nineties grunge which a certain kind of girl will probably buy no matter how much it costs.,,Journalists are still not permitted to ask Slimane any questions backstage so we've no clue about his objective. (It's also notable that Cathy Horyn who was lambasted by Slimane on Twitter after her critique of his collection last season did not write anything about this collection.) But here's what we do know: Slimane knows how to get attention and knows that by pissing everyone off he'll get that much more notoriety. And notoriety sells.,,While no one dared to speak ill of the collection outright few responses were positive (the Times' Eric Wilson perhaps went the smartest route by quoting overheard anonymous editors). Here's a roundup of reactions:,,"So we get it. Slimane is remaking Saint Laurent. It's young. It's sexy. It's très rock and roll. A gazillion girls who love Urban Outfitters' signature homage to Seattle Grunge will adore this luxed-up version … But he needs to have more faith in the enduring allure of beautifully engineered pieces - and riff on them some more next season. Neither he - nor Saint Laurent - requires the styling tics of a 20-year-old teenage music revolution." -Lisa Armstrong for the Telegraph,,,,,,"Few archetypes are more engaging than the undone girl especially when under her ratty hair pout pounding gait and sloppy chic lurk a pretty face and skinny body. But is playing a cutesy disaffected-youth hand enough to propel the house of Saint Laurent into today's luxury stratosphere - especially if the targeted air space is that in which Chanel and Dior reside? That too remains a question." -WWD,,"I feel like he's playing a huge joke on the entire fashion industry." -Anonymous editor quoted by Eric Wilson in the Times,,"It's haute couture made grunge … It's very L.A." -Kirsten Dunst quoted by Eric Wilson in the Times,,,,,,"Many editors present did not appear to be in love with the concept but there were many pieces that looked commercially lucrative … The connection of grunge to Mr. Saint Laurent was less clear though he did once produce a fragrance called Baby Doll and a pink fur coat in Mr. Slimane's show seemed a nod to a famous fox coat design of the early 1970s called the 'chubby.'" -Eric Wilson for the Times ,fashion,hedi slimane,saint laurent,1990s,grunge, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjf5d7SjUV1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:a_3x-horizontal.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:a_3x-horizontal.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They have used their year in the spotlight to expose injustice,Depending on how you define it the most important performance by a rock band in 2012 lasted either less than two minutes or a full nine days.Pussy Riot's guerrilla rendition of Punk Prayer: Mother of God Drive Putin Away in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour Moscow on 21 February was brief even by punk standards and less striking and significant to non-Russian eyes than the band's rooftop appearance in Red Square a month earlier. But the vindictive trial that ensued was a major international media event which revealed both the depth of the defendants' courage and intelligence and the power of popular music to illuminate a political situation. At a recent House of Commons event organised by Kerry McCarthy MP who attended the trial the musician and critic John Robb suggested that the church gig was merely the soundcheck and the trial was the real show.,Contrary to Putin's sneering remark that "they got what they asked for" Maria Alyokhina Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich didn't set out to get prosecuted. A shrewder less authoritarian government would have stayed its hand and let interest in the group peter out instead of breaking a butterfly on a wheel with a prosecution that reprised the tragedy of Communist show trials as farce. Once they were granted a platform that they had never sought the three women with admirable clarity and dignity used it to put their accusers on trial. "The Russian authorities took a marginal act of arty protest and through sheer cruelty made it into an international cause" wrote Michael Idov the editor-in-chief of GQ Russia adding that coverage of the trial amounted to "long infomercials against investing in visiting and generally dealing with Russia". Tobi Vail whose early 90s Riot Grrrlband Bikini Kill was one of Pussy Riot's inspirations wasn't being too hyperbolic when she called them "The only band that matters in 2012.",What Pussy Riot understand so keenly is Allen Ginsberg's observation in the 1960s that "national politics was theatre on a vast scale with scripts timing sound systems. Whose theatre would attract the most customers whose was a theatre of ideas that could be gotten across?" Viewed purely as a pop group they are faultless: the unforgettable name whose punchy collision of sex and violence is a feminised radicalised take on the Sex Pistols; the uniform of bright dresses and balaclavas which makes them both memorable and anonymous; the terse splenetic punk racket; the unlicensed occupation of public spaces for their performances and their subsequent dissemination on social media. In her closing statement to the court Tolokonnikova said: "We were searching for real sincerity and simplicity and we found these qualities in the holy foolishness of punk.",Although their unusually tight post-trial release Putin Lights Up the Fires is as strong as many Riot Grrrl records Pussy Riot are like only a handful of western bands – Crass Public Enemy the Last Poets – political provocateurs first and musicians second. They make words image and noise tell the same story so that you can see them in action for one minute and still get the message.,Some seasoned Russia-watchers have grumbled about young women in colourful balaclavas receiving immeasurably more international attention than other persecuted dissidents. They might as well complain that rain is wet. Pussy Riot are clever and committed enough to express themselves in more sober ways if they wanted but they chose to exploit the media to the hilt because they know how it works – in the words of 60s Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman they "fight through the jungles of TV". Their fame has not eclipsed other injustices in Russia but highlighted them in the tradition of opposition movements strategically promoting charismatic individuals from Nelson Mandela to Ai Wei Wei as synecdoches for an entire cause. For newly curious observers outside Russia Pussy Riot have lifted the curtain on the regime's intolerance.,There is nothing accidental about this and nothing trivial about the women themselves. We are used to musicians making inspiring protest songs then fumbling the follow-up as they try to paper over the gaps in their knowledge with stirring simplifications. Not Pussy Riot. They sprang in October 2011 from the anarchist art collective Voina(meaning "war") with an arsenal of political theory. The scope of their concerns is broad from education and healthcare to feminism LGBT rights and Russia's culture of conformity. Two of them were arrested for taking part in Moscow's banned Gay Pride rally last year. Their concerts by laying claim to public spaces are Situationist-inspired acts of dissent even before a note has been played. It's perhaps misleading to call them a band. The five who performed in the cathedral (two fled the country to avoid arrest) are only part of a shifting collective that numbers up to 20. Tolokonnikova sees their work as "modern art".,Samutsevich told Rolling Stone: "Art has become only more complicated. Now it's done internationally and it has great political potential. An artist is a person who is constantly analysing critical thoughts always working out an independent opinion regarding everything. That is why art gives a breath of fresh air and a different way to protest.",So when the prosecution depicted them as Satanic hooligans and their defence team complained Samutsevich "made us look like teenage girls that went against Putin without even understanding why they are … doing it" the trio proved themselves to be calm courageous impeccably well-informed women whose eloquent statements to the court quoted Dostoevsky Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Brodsky. "Compared to the judicial machine we are nobodies and we have lost" said Samutsevich. "On the other hand we have won … The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. Once again the world sees Russia differently than the way Putin tries to present it at his daily international meetings." Even some members of Putin's United Russia party agreed with one publicly complaining the indictment "makes the country the laughing stock of the entire world.", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashion,art,1990s,grunge,feminism,activism, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjf5pqMZES1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Berlin haben jeweils unterschiedliche Designs beigetragen die auf neueren ihrer Kunstwerke basieren.,Die Kunstwerke auf denen die Beiträge von Baribeaud und Montgomery beruhen wurden im vergangenen Jahr in Berlin ausgestellt. Die drei Looks von Baribeaud namens „Monsters" „Sandsturm" und „Zeitspirale" basieren auf Gouachen auf Papier die er im März 2012 beiNolan Judin ausstellte. „All places are temporary places" eine Neonarbeit von Montgomery auf der sein Design beruht ist noch bis zum 9. März an der Außenwand von C/O Berlin in Berlin-Mitte zu sehen. Der Künstler ist in London lebender Schotte ist; aber diese Arbeit entstand wie die weiteren die in die Zusammenarbeit mit Surface to Air eingeflossen sind während eines Künstleraufenthaltsprogramms im vergangenen Sommer in Berlin.,,Der Beitrag von Young zeigt Teile seines Beitrags zu der Whitney-Biennale von 2006. Statt Bronzefelsen verwendet Young nun Sweatshirts und T-shirts mit Sätzen wie „Go Home!" „Go back to the Valley!" und „Locals Only!" – Sätze die in der Surferszene von Kalifornien oft fallen. Young der seit 2010 beiGagosian ausstellt hat eine Vorliebe dafür Gegenkultur und kommerziellen Mainstream zu vermengen; so erscheint die Zusammenarbeit ausgesprochen passend.,,Sehen Sie Bilder der Beiträge aller drei Künstler für die Kollektion von Surface to Air in der Bilderstrecke.,, , , , , , , ,art,fashion, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjf6hxPw2F1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:untitled_32.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Using a Kinect and a standard DSLR camera like your Canon 5D these avant-garde image-makers have created a technique that allows you to map video from the SLR onto the Kinect's 3D data to generate a true CGI and video hybrid.,Why is this exciting? Well for one thing convincing CGI is incredibly difficult to do-it took the team behind Rockstar'sL.A. Noire a full 32 cameras and god knows how many man hours to record and digitally reconstruct their characters in 360 degrees. And while the experimental output from the RGB+D team is a far cry from those painstakingly constructed game visuals that's kind of not the point. The point is the implications-this has the potential to change the way we think of 3D filmmaking and to significantly lower the barrier to entry using commercially available hardware and open source software.,Today members of the RGB+D team-James George and Jonathan Minard-released the culmination of their research to date: an excerpt of an ongoing documentary project called Clouds that they've been developing alongside the RGB+D Toolkit their open source video editing application (which looks like a cross between Final Cut Pro and a video game engine). Clouds features interviews with prominent computer hackers media artists and critics discussing the creative use of code the future of data interfaces and computational visuals presented as a series of conversational vignettes.,,An in-edit view of the Clouds documentary as seen in the RGB+D Toolkit edit timeline.,"It is an infinite conversation a networked portrait an experiment in virtual cinema" explains Minard who works as a new media documentarian and is a fellow at Carnegie Mellon's Studio for Creative Inquiry where he first joined forces with developer James George and recorded the first series of interviews for Clouds during the Art && Code conferencelast year.,"The goal behind the documentary is to capture the creative hacker ethos in a media that suits the subject" explains George. "Clouds is a window into the mentality of the scene responsible for inventing the format that was used to create the film." Which is probably why anyone who is familiar with the aesthetics of data visualization or has seen one of the countless Kinect hack demos from the past year will recognize influences of both in the film's style. "The subjects float in a black void their figures composed of tiny points connected by lines that flicker and break apart at the edges" continues George. "They're made out of pure computational matter-the same material the artists depicted work with on a daily basis.",Though they used a stationary one camera set-up the 3D Kinect data they capture allows them to render out the images any way they can dream up (and code up) and rephotograph their subjects from any angle in post production.,"It starts to break down the notion that CGI and live action are different approaches to filmmaking and suggests the two will become so deeply entangled that we won't be able to tell the difference anymore" says George. "This documentary and the toolkit put the potential of that merger front and center and show where it's headed. But it's always more interesting to create something from our imagination than to try to recreate reality. The true surprises are going to come from how we can reinterpret captured reality in ways that have never been seen before.",And that re-imagination of reality is precisely what the RGB+D team have started to play with in Clouds. Anyone who has ever worked with a Kinect knows that the capture is imperfect and incomplete. Accordingly the holographic-looking visages presented in Clouds have an eerie quality to them-spotty shaky slightly glitched out and blurred as if they're being broadcast from far far away through a weak transmission signal.,Nevertheless it's precisely this factor that makes it so arresting. There's something about it (perhaps the black void in the background perhaps the sound design) that has the feel of a deep space or deep sea exploration film. The viewer has the sensation of voyaging into the unknown and discovering strange but beautiful creatures there. The interspersed elements of visual abstraction where the talking head suddenly breaks apart into a point of glittering dots or undulating wireframes serve not only as representations of things being discussed in the dialogue but as experimental filmic gestures that hint at an emerging new aesthetic that the RGB+D team is only beginning to cultivate.,,A sampling of the visual treatments being explored by the RGB+D team in the Clouds documentary.,The project is continuing to evolve as the team travels around to creative coding conferences to conduct more interviews. In addition to Art && Code they captured a large portion of interviews at Resonate Festival in Belgrade this March and are preparing for another of fresh scans at the upcoming EyeO festival. The editing software is constantly getting spruced up too with support from Eyebeam Art + Technology center in NYC and the Studio for Creative Inquiry in Pittsburgh.,We caught up with the filmmakers via email to learn more about their plans for the film and the RGB+D Toolkit.,What was the goal in developing the RGB+D toolkit and the documentary itself?James: The goal behind the toolkit is to capture our aesthetic research and make discoveries repeatable. We've been working with the Kinect+SLR technique since Alexander Porter and I first experimented in the NYC subway with a sensor rubber-banded to an SLR. Every time we do a new project the tool grows. Because everyone involved has different backgrounds it's super important that the tool can be used by people who aren't programmers so everything is controlled through a graphical user interface.,Jonathan: As a documentary filmmaker with a background in new media art and anthropology I am interested in stories of invention and discovery: how people develop new tools and how those tools shape the collective imagination. This project has all those elements. It's no coincidence that this documentary realized in a computational format explores the subject of code and culture. Form should reflect content. A principle feature of this project is that it's a documentary about media art in which the movie is itself a new media experiment.,Why did you choose to release it open source as opposed to developing a proprietary software/technique?James: If everyone can do it no one can own it and it becomes part of the world of visual culture rather than any individual artist's personal aesthetic. We could try to be protective of our techniques but we'd end up becoming a one-trick pony. It's much more interesting to release the app and watch it run wild.,Jonathan: What's most exciting about this new technique is that it's so young and formless and malleable as a medium. As it evolves we can include our friends in the process of collectively imagining what it might become. This I have learned is one of the benefits of open source coding: software is never finished it can always be improved extended and reinvented. As long as this medium stays alive there's no limit to where it might go.,Tell me a little about the mood and feel you were hoping to establish with the aesthetic treatment you've given the data?Jonathan: In the opening scene of Clouds Philip (@underdoeg) emerges from a chaos of particles in a digital void and says "With coding you can do whatever you want… it's like there's nothing in the beginning and then you start throwing things in there." It felt appropriate to open the film with a metaphorical cosmogenesis. We play with the idea that coders become gods by creating digital universes from nothing. The virtual actors reside in a slippery zone between form and formlessness. We wanted to establish their immateriality acknowledging the fact that they are not solid beings but information objects assembled from nothing more than clouds of 3D pixels in a frameless black box.,James: We wanted the tone to land somewhere between quirky and cosmic-an approximation of what it's like to hang out with a creative programmer for a day. The treatment we've given the data is reflexively raw and humble. We are working with points lines and triangles-the basic building blocks of real-time 3D graphics. The effects we use to augment the narration are simple code tricks like Perlin particle systems basic noise and sine wave generators. We are exposing the format's raw elements to educate the audience to our visual language. At the same time we are relating the cultural mentality. This is the start of the process I think the flashy stuff will come next.,,Creative coders J.T. Nimoy (top) and Marcus Wendt (bottom) rendered as abstract wireframed figures.,How do you hope to continue developing this project? What are the next steps for you?Jonathan: The project is a journey an exploration to see how far we can go toward developing a new aesthetic of cinema with tools at our disposal. What began as a design fiction-imaging the camera of the future-has come closer and closer to a real thing. And yet it remains an intermediate format aspiring toward something so amazing that we can only vaguely describe what it looks and feels like.

The concept apparel showcased at the search giant's swanky SXSW Interactive headquarters is part of a new arts project - "Art Copy Code" – which aims to breathe a social life-like experience into everyday objects. "If standing still was a sport you'd be world champion" the trash-talking shoe projects on a monitor hanging over a rainbow-colored obstacle course after it senses I've been standing still.,At a distance users seem a tad pathetic trying to trigger positive feedback from the shoe.

Essentially it's Richards Simmons in a shoe.,In case critics think this is another one of Google's flights of profitless creative fancy Arts Copy Code is deliberately about improving advertising. "It's explicitly aimed at how translating how Silicon Valley thinks about technology into how creative agencies think about advertising" says project lead Aman Govil.,Brands such as Nike who outfit professional athletes with health-tracking shoes and bracelets could broadcast an athlete's spring-training performance in realtime. Rival athletes' apparel could trash talk one another automatically.,It's still (very) early days for the arts project. The talking shoe (and shoe strap) concept was developed through a grant to electronics agency Yes Yes No. Google plans to open up the project to more everyday objects in the near future. One hypothetical use-case imagines Govil is an alarm block that sends snarky messages to co-workers if users have to hit the snooze on their alarm clock more than three times.,There's been heightened attention to research that quantifies how much our friends affect our weight success and personal lives. University of San Diego political scientist and Connected author James Fowler found that having an obese friend can significantly increase people's chances of also having their own set of marshmallowy love handles. And it's no secret that a spirited friend can get us up at 5 a.m. for a morning run as much as they can tempt us into finishing their plate of fries.,Health startups have attempted to "gamify" good behavior by encouraging users to share personal goals with friends. Nike+ FuelBand for instance shares users' exercise habits with their friends on the personal social network Path.,This project attempts to remove the barrier presented by current products. The social aspect has always required one extra step of human effort. However fast a one-word message of encouragement could take to type about a friend's morning run the minor inconvenience is enough to seriously limit engagement. This new automated personality seems to have a place especially when we're all too busy to be personal.,Currently the project is just a concept. There's no need to jump over to the Google Play store and find the buy link. But Google Glass was just a concept at one point too.,(via Forget Google Glass Google Debuts 'Talking Shoe' Concept At SXSWi Wants More Social Motivational Everyday Objects | TechCrunch), , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,wearables,latour,object-oriented, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjg9xmfefe1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Blessing Hancock and Joe O'Connell an artistic duo based in Tuscon Arizona have recently given the students of Texas State University a very large toy with which to play. As well as being a serious piece of art with an equally serious message it looks like great fun too.,,Fish Bellies as the installation has been christened is created from a series of bolted acrylic sheets sculpted together to form a large biomorphic form. O'Connell and Hancock drew their inspiration from the nearby San Marcos River. The waterway is host to great biological diversity and the installation draws parallels between the life aquatic and the life academic.,,Any and every university should be teeming with a miscellaneous not to mention motley student body in order to thrive and survive. And of course we all know that students can be different creatures when the sun goes down. Fish Bellies may look like a simple school of fish in the day time but when the evening draws in it is transformed in to a bioluminescent landscape.,,That's when the fun begins. O'Connell and Hancock have fitted the installation with touch sensitive technology. The students are able to control the internal LED structure by adjusting Fish Bellies' color spectrum. In as much as it is meant to spark interest in the distinctive ecology and biology of the San Marcos River I am fairly sure it has earned any number of positive expressive comments in its own right.,,http://bit.ly/WeTi8p, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,kuriositas,architecture,light,noreply@blogger.com (rj evans), , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjg6qnMg9o1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeThRZ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkgD,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8f,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwR,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwT,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8j,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8l,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwV,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Y8yTS6, , , , , , , , , , ,

For example if you brought in a design for something ordinarily made of leather but spec'd it for steel and you couldn't back up your reason for the materials choice he would excoriate you. "That's not profound that's not clever" he would rant. "The materials are supposed to serve the design not whimsy.",Still sometimes it's fun (particularly when there's no danger of an "F" looming over your head) to see videos like this one where materials experimentation is done just for the hell of it. To create a piece of "ride-able art" the guys at California-based Signal Snowboards visited some of Italy's master glass manufacturers to see if a glass snowboard was do-able.,The first stop was the Vetrerira Aurora glass factory in Brescia where the board is first cut and formed. (Who knew you could hot-bend and laminate multiple layers of glass together like a skate deck?) Stop two was glass magicians Viraver Technologies where the glass was tempered bonded and cooked. Then came the biq questions: How would it perform on ice hard pack powder?

The microhome listed recently for $1200 boasts big windows a transparent roof a sleeping platform and perhaps its most valuable asset a New York Times mention. When the Times covered Deek and his backyard menagerie of rickshaws sleeping huts and forts the tiny lodge was dubbed "Gypsy Junker"-though it really looks nothing like Portland's tiny gypsy mobile home nor the place Charles Dickens once called his "gypsy summer tent." Deek is selling the cabin to make room on his Boston property for future projects which include a houseboat and a tiny house on wheels: "I actually don't want to part with this so much but my yard is so small and I need to make way."

But Ryoichi Kurokawa's piece Oscillating Continuum shrinks this right back to create a hypnotic audiovisual sculpture set in a gallery space.,Two screens housed in conjoined boxes show a horizontal red line that comes pulsing to life with the crackling audio as waves of abstract shapes and intricate linear patterns breakout across the white background.,The piece's minimalist setup causes the viewer to focus their attention even more than they would watching it on a stage making the sudden movements the splintered but detailed graphics and the eruption of seething forms even more startling. Much like Kurokawa's other work the piece gives an almost tangible presence to the low humming drone and hiss of the music.,@stewart23rd,http://bit.ly/YnPE8P, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,the creators project,art,interface,tech, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjidwprwUJ1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:16muyPN, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In addition Google showed off a first round of applications that work on Glass including how Gmail works on the device as well as integrations from companies like the New York Times Evernote Path and others.,The Mirror API is essentially a REST API which should make developing for it very easy for most developers. The Glass device essentially talks to Google's servers and the developers' applications then get the data from there and also push it to Glass through Google's APIs. All of this data is then presented on Glass through what Google calls "timeline cards." These cards can include text images rich HTML and video. Besides single cards Google also lets developers use what it calls bundles which are basically sets of cards that users can navigate using their voice or the touchpad on the side of Glass.,Here is a brief video of the Glass demo at SXSW today (via @panzer):,It looks like sharing to Google+ is a built-in feature of the Mirror API but as Google's Timothy Jordan noted in today's presentation developers can always add their own sharing options as well. Other built-in features seem to include voice recognition access to the camera and a text-to-speech engine.,Glass Rules,Because Glass is a new and unique form factor Jordan also noted Google is setting a few rules for Glass apps. They shouldn't for example show full news stories but only headlines as everything else would be too distracting. For longer stories developers can always just use Glass to read text to users.,Essentially developers should make sure that they don't annoy users with too many notifications and the data they send to Glass should always be relevant. Developers should also make sure that everything that happens on Glass should be something the user expects said Jordan. Glass isn't the kind of device he said where a push notification about an update to your app makes sense.,Using Glass With Gmail Evernote Path and Others,As part of today's presentation Jordan also detailed some Glass apps Google has been working on itself and apps that some of its partners have created. The New York Times app for example shows headlines and then lets you listen to a summary of the article by telling Glass to "read aloud." Google's own Gmail app uses voice recognition to answer emails (and it obviously shows you incoming mail as well). Evernote's Skitch can be used to take and share photos and Jordan also showed a demo of social network Path running on Glass to share your location.,So far there is no additional information about the Mirror API on any of Google's usual sites but we expect the company to release more information shortly and will update this post once we hear more.,Tip of the hat to our friends at Engadget for their live blog of today's event and to our own John Biggs for the photos.,(via Google Details Glass Mirror API At SXSW Shows Off Gmail NYT Evernote And Path Integrations | TechCrunch), , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,glass,google,google glass,rules,interface,design,notifications, , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjjt5sa7IO1s75lgto1_100.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:img_4870.jpg?w=300&h=200,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:img_4866.jpg?w=300&h=270, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The first feature which shows data on how many people have pinned from a site the number of views each pin has and how many users have visited a site from Pinterest is available for free today for companies with a verified Web site.,,These new features make good on Pinterest's promise to businesses late last year that it will introduce data analytic tools for companies to track Pinterest traffic. Pinterest which began offering official accounts for companies in November is focusing this year on "building foundations to monetize" founder Ben Silbermann told the Wall Street Journal last month. The Web site does not currently have paid ads but it's looking at a potential advertising system as well as working with businesses to learn how Pinterest can result in sales of merchandise a potential revenue source for the site. Pinterest recently updated its site for business owners which includes case studies from companies including Etsy and Allrecipes.,Other features Pinterest may unveil later this year include "suggestions" for users based on what they have already added to their boards. The company also plans to launch international sites this year.,Despite its current lack of revenue Pinterest raised a whopping $200 million last month from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners in round that put the company's valuation at $2.5 billion. The Web site has already shown that it is a potent marketing tool for businesses. Last July data from online sharing service Shareaholic showed that Pinterest beat Twitter StumbleUpon Bing and Google in referral traffic. Furthermore Pinterest users don't just click over to e-commerce sites to ogle merchandise–they are 10 percent more likely to make a purchase than people who come over from other networks according to data from e-commerce platform Shopify.,(via Pinterest Launches New Data Analytic Tool For Businesses As It Prepares To Monetize | TechCrunch), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,pinterest,analytics,sharing, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjjt8g7Mw71s75lgto1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:webanalytics_1.png?w=640&h=542,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:webanalytics_3.png?w=640&h=503, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"Consumers will now be able to view and share authentic Condé Nast video series across all platforms in easily-accessible ways.",So what have Glamour and GQ cooked up?,For the former there's "Elevator Makeover" in which a girl gets a makeover in an elevator "Glamour Dos and Don'ts of the Week" which counts down things that are hot and things that are not "Fashion Week Ride-Along" which follows EIC Cindi Leive through NYFW and "Why Do Guys…" in which female comedians go out and interview guys on the street.,GQ's programming is obviously a little more masculine. There's "Fighting Weight" a fitness series "The Ten" in which male celebs count down 10 things they can't live without "Car Collectors" in which male celebs talk about cars and "Jogging with James" another fitness show that follows James Marshall "a stylish adventurer-entrepreneur now married to supermodel Elettra Wiedemann" on his challenge of running the Marathon de Sabl.,Both titles also feature behind-the-scenes videos from shoots and interviews with cover stars as any magazine's website would.,Condé isn't the first publishing house to launch a video network. In fact it may even be a little late to the game–Hearst did it about a year ago by launching Hello Style includingHarper's Bazaar's Laura Brown-hosted series "The Look" (which we love) as well asMarie Claire and Cosmo branded series that are more like video extensions of their print features.,Even smaller magazines have increased video content and the amount of resources and staff dedicated to them–a natural result of print circulation dwindling forcing magazines to find new ways of engaging audiences and promoting themselves as brands online.,It will be interesting to see what this means for Condé's more high-end exclusive titles such as Vanity Fair and Vogue. Vogue.com's newish "Mondays With André" series is already a hit in our eyes. We wonder what else it has up its sleeve.,Continue reading , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashionista,content,fashion,media,dhani mau, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjk310gvAl1s75lgto1_250.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

An Apple for the teacherYet another treatise on Steve Jobs? [1] As an "architect" - really? And with Apple seemingly waning aren't we behind the curve on this? [2] Suffice it to say that my interest is not solely in Steven Paul Jobs himself but rather in the challenge that the late computer impresario and legendary technologist poses to the methods and purpose of an architectural historian - starting with one who teaches across disciplines at a public university near Apple's lair in the Bay Area of California. My job and my location place me close enough to Silicon Valley that students might fairly assume that I have something cogent to say about all this (they have already indicated as much). Now Apple is working with Norman Foster to build a donut-spaceship as its headquarters in Cupertino. But since architectural stories are surprising rare here on the edge of the continent I need a shtick; no matter my connoisseur-ish personal tastes and leftist political dispositions. So what are my options? Compare and contrast that trusty standby of art history in which I drill my students. I can compare Jobs with … with whom exactly? Bill Gates or maybe Thomas Edison? That route would take us away from design away from architectural history away from aesthetics. Not necessarily a bad outcome and like many architectural historians I pay close attention to both Science and Technology Studies and Cultural Studies which are the disciplines perhaps most comfortable with technology and the American experience. But neither the Apple HQ or the iPhone for that matter readily lend themselves to STS and Cultural Studies' emphases on flattened and distributed innovation and on user-generated meanings. [3] So any methods I might borrow from those anthropologically-inclined fields will need to be augmented by the emphases on authorship and aesthetics that architectural history traditionally draws from art history: peel away his ruthless command of global consumer markets and Jobs can seem to the art historian more akin to Gropius than Gates. But Jobs's ruthless command of markets is a fact that cannot be peeled away; and so we are obliged to deploy the criticality that has been central to architectural historical method since say Tomás Maldonado and Manfredo Tafuri. [4] In other words: I am duty-bound to tell students that design is not necessarily benign especially when it seems to be. Yet they can see me teaching from the MacBook I am writing on even now. Some of the students I have trained will graduate into Silicon Valley. I wonder what that suggests about my own complicity with the very things which I am attempting to critique? How does my salary my adopted state my consumption tie me to all this? So I discreetly edge the conversation back to my own disciplinary competence by comparing the design for the new Apple headquarters with other corporate buildings. We take another iconic and somehow ominous HQ - OMA's recently completed CCTV tower in Beijing - and we then compare Jobs with OMA's head Rem Koolhaas. Yes as though they were both architects. And then we treat Jobs as though he were an offshoot of a Bay Area design history that was substantially driven by architecture. My concern after all is to have something to say about design in the far western region where I teach; even though major monumental buildings are scarce on the ground here and even though the politics of good design are adulterated by my state's politics of good business. This effort then becomes a test of the limits of my discipline devoted as it has long been to the maintenance of European critical traditions and to monumentality and the public sphere and to the continued preeminence of the academic institutions of Northern Europe and the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. Such is the fate of many an émigré architectural historian in California at once living and working within a global engine of economy design ideology and media yet rather far from the concatenations of Greater New England architectural historical scholarship. We wonder whether there is any more that can be said about the Mission Style the Case Study Houses the freeways; or whether anything whatsoever can be said about California's inland agricultural empire of the Central Valley which is where I live.Norman Foster's design for the Apple headquarters center surrounded by the California architectural historian's canon. [Photos clockwise by Eli Pousson Neil Kremer Dystopus Keith Daly Chris McSorley Allan FergusonMyDifferentDrum and Roberto Estremo]     I believe that there is. But to talk about Jobs as though he were an architect - already a dubious proposition - is to talk as well about advanced capitalism about global systems the counterculture Zen Buddhism and all manner of phenomena apparently inimical to the critical tradition to monumentality and the public sphere. This threatens to liquefy my discipline through a Golden State looking-glass. Maybe I should emulate the resolve of the philosophers Adorno and Horkheimer both of whom stranded in sunny Los Angeles during the war refused to succumb to California languor. And yet; my faculty appointment is here expectant students are assembled and to be frank I think that architectural-historical methodology can benefit from this modest test and prevail. So here I offers no scoops or intrigues into the Zen Master Jobs. This is one of those experiments in method encouraged - forced - by the study of California: here subject and method evolve symbiotically as befits scholarship in a region enamored with holistic thought even as my disciplinary training prevents me from ever going fully native. 2. Why it's simpler to treat Jobs as a California Modern Architect To the subject at hand. To my mind treating Jobs as an architect has merit if for no other reason than to bring to some sort of conclusion the popular psychologizing of what made him tick. It is no secret that Jobs was a "complicated" man. Unusually so perhaps though nothing more typifies the persona of the "great architect" driven to get his ideas executed with minimum compromise somehow distrustful of people yet seemingly concerned about their welfare preferring to channel politics through design rather than to actually participate in political activity. "Despite the myriad ways his companies improved our lives Jobs was a hero only in the Ayn Randian sense" writes The Nation's Eric Alterman de facto connecting Jobs via Rand to that archetype of the "complicated" architect Howard Roark a.k.a. Frank Lloyd Wright. [5] A sense of what you might call "psychopathic humanism" attends such personalities: they are determined to improve the human lot no matter how many individual humans they offend along the way. Bucking our current postmodern era Jobs and Koolhaas both seem to have been driven by the possibility that they can act inside or around a postmodern world resistant to purpose. Jobs and Koolhaas share I suspect an attraction toward design as a type of hermeneutics - a will to learn about the world through the attempt to change it. Koolhaas assigned his Harvard students and OMA assistants to track aesthetic multiplier effects through the study of shopping and of African urbanism; he is passionate in a manner worthy of a surrealist or second-order cybernetician about paradox and overdetermination. [6] Meanwhile both the personnel and the customers of the Apple Corporation functioned as an extension of Jobs and not simply through the authoritarian exertion of will. In this sense Jobs hasn't died in the same way that Mies van der Rohe hasn't died: something of his very thinking his gestalt has been learned by other designers and consumers and in this way Jobs's legacy - like influential pedagogy - is "architectural." That Jobs's work his products has constituted a daily part of people's lives over several generations was testified to by the peculiar and public demonstrations of grief at his passing.Steve Jobs memorial Apple store San Francisco. [Photo by raumish]Koolhaas for sure is a redoubtable figure for historians and theorists of architecture in a way that Jobs never will be. Judged by his impact on architectural pedagogy and his reception by critics he probably remains our most important living architect popular with scholars to the degree that he is apparently unpopular with even obscure to the public at large. Koolhaas invites interpretation. In contrast scholars are left practically redundant by the sheer popularity of Jobs's work: there is apparently no work of interpretation left for us to do. We can try to deepen our analyses of Jobs by say citing the pivotal influential ofindustrial designers like Dieter Rams; but accounting for Koolhaas's interests in the surrealist paranoiac-critical method Soviet Constructivism and Italian Autonomist Marxism would require graduate-seminar-level exegesis. Put another way: if Koolhaas's aesthetic is difficult Jobs's is dumb. The categorical difference is that one really is an architect steeped in the arts and the other is an ambitious industrial designer steeped in the applied arts; which is why Koolhaas presents an explanatory challenge Jobs a functional literalness. I am not so sure about this distinction though; whatever the philosophical and formal challenges which Koolhaas's buildings pose they function well. And Jobs's intellectual formation was easily as esoteric as that of Koolhaas. It's no surprise then that architect Norman Foster has referred to Jobs as though he were a professional peer "in every way so much more than a client" as Foster put it in his tribute. "We are better as individuals and certainly wiser as architects through the experience of … working for him. … His participation was so intense and creative that our memory will be that of working with one of the truly great designers and mentors." [7] (This is the sort of language we might expect Foster to have reserved for his earlier mentor Richard Buckminster Fuller - another figure whose functionalism anathema to the richly formal work of Koolhaas is adored in Bay Area.) When Jobs's name is used as a search term in the scholarly Avery Index to architectural history it retrieves a 2005 article from Britain's ID magazine that lists in this order the most influential design thinkers in the world: the Museum of Modern Art's Design Department Steve Jobs Rem Koolhaas. For ID at least we are in some way comparing like with like. And the listing of Jobs with MoMA and Koolhaas has the intriguing effect of drawing a westward axis of transnational design as it transposes from The Netherlands then to the United States via New York and Northern California then onward to China where Jobs and Koolhaas confirm their incendiary reputations in the factories of Shenzhen and the political machine of Beijing. The modernist tradition becomes - to use Koolhaas's celebrated term - increasingly delirious as it gravitates from the Heroic Age Netherlands to Jazz Age New York to Aquarian Age California. If Koolhaas has capitalized upon a distinctively Dutch taste and Northern European aesthetic Jobs has championed a distinctively Californian energy. In the early 1980s the German industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger proposed that there should be a "born-in-America gene for Apple's DNA" one that would produce what Esslinger called a "California global" look. Esslinger then newly arrived in the United States initially suggested that Apple's aesthetic be inspired by "Hollywood and music a bit of rebellion and natural sex appeal." [8] But Hollywood rock music sex appeal and rebellion did not prevail in the iconic forms that embody the Apple brand identity created so obsessively by Jobs. In its stores in its devices even in the book cover he designed for Walter Isaacson's biography (which he himself commissioned Isaacson to write) Jobs recovered a vision of the modern as clarified normative truthful perhaps somewhat German though even more Zen. Is there a relationship between California and these qualities of clarification normativity truthfulness and Zen? I believe that Apple really does represent a genus of Californian design - that the slogan "Designed by Apple in California" conveys something like an ethos.Top and Middle: Norman Foster drawings for Apple headquarters Cupertino California projected 2015. Bottom: Bernard Maybeck Palace of Fine Arts San Francisco 1915. [Photo by Wally Gobetz]Apple's image evolved markedly from the early 1980s to now but it remained consistent with Bay Area taste from the countercultural feel of the offerings to be found in (say) its early-'80s gift collections [9] -with their totes kites belt buckles wall hangings and rug kits - to the New Age aura of transcendent consciousness and spirituality of more recent Mac products their concealed LEDs practicing controlled yogic breathing when left on standby. Apple was a Bay Area company led by a lifelong Bay Area homeboy steeped in such Bay Area enthusiasms as the Whole Earth Catalog and The Grateful Dead. [10] In the dominant culture of the Bay Area - if I can indulge in a sweeping summary - you find a deep distaste for representing established culture: culture is to be invented here and now and to be lived rather than observed and learned. It is a culture that imagines itself as exploring truth and possibility. This is a trait stretching back through several generations of Northern California designers - Bernard Maybeck is my personal favorite with his eccentric combinations of materials technique and historical association. Jobs too pursued an aesthetics of truth and possibility. Compare the design of two corporate animation facilities one for The Walt Disney Company in Southern California the other for Jobs's Pixar in Northern California. In his 1991 design for the Team Disney building in Burbank Michael Graves employs the Seven Dwarves as Atlantes not only to symbolize a passing world of animated arts but also to make an inside joke about the conclusion of classical civilization. In contrast in their Pixar Studios in Emeryville Bohlin Cywinski Jackson deploy the patterning of bricks of different hues to make decoration immanent to the materials themselves in this way suggesting that the building itself is pixelated - a pattern waiting to be orchestrated. Facts before pictures. The tectonic and material truths of this factory of the virtual feel hyper-real. Its hand-laid brick courses suggest an unnerving sincerity far removed from the postmodern irony of Graves or the postmodern tragedy of Koolhaas. The Bohlin Cywinski Jackson practice founded in 1965 in Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania under the sway of Louis Kahn (that vital transitional figure between modernism and postmodernism who recovered architectural verity from dogmatic functionalism and returned it to custom ritual and place) has proven adept at delivering to commercial and technological clients buildings of a local phenomenological intensity. In 1997 the firm completed the residential compound of another computer maven one Bill Gates of Bellevue WA in an earnest regional "Pacific Lodge" style. A couple of years later Bohlin Cywinski Jackson opened its San Francisco office to handle the Pixar campus for Jobs. What they delivered doesn't look much like a fun factory. The main pavilion is an elegant warehouse its flat arches an acknowledgement of the local light-industry context with plate glass recalling the notoriously generic corporate architecture of Silicon Valley. The Pixar campus is a place for serious research not decorative puns; a place where the arts of animation from the classic era of Disney are preserved within three-dimensional computer modeling originally developed for medical imaging; a place to discover the sorts of truths about the self and the world that were earlier discovered in the Marin County summer camps Palo Alto garages East Bay cafés Silicon Valley laboratories and Silicon Alley warehouses recalled by the campus ensemble.Top: Michael Graves Team Disney Building Burbank California. [Photo by Loren Javier] Middle and Bottom: Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Steve Jobs Building Pixar Campus Emeryville California. [Photos by John Lambert Pearson middle and Michael Heilemann bottom]The comic foil provided by the monumental Luxo lamp is an addition. The lamp - an homage to Pixar's celebrated 1986 demo reel "Luxo Jr." - was a gift from Australia as though Pixar were a new nation - a corporate nation that reaffirms the Bay Area as a center of the creative world (with a nod in the naming of its new building "Brooklyn" to an East Coast counterpart). Jobs was the undisputed ruler of this nation; Pixar employees knew him to be the hidden hand in the building's design [11] and Jobs was always adamant that all core creative production for his companies would happen in the Bay Area in real diurnal time defying the industry trend for the globalized dissipation of the design process across facilities specializations and time zones. [12] At a Cupertino City Council meeting in June 2011 a clearly ailing Jobs made what I assume was his last public appearance to present the plans for the new Apple HQ; he promoted the Foster + Partners design as a great entity in a traditionalist Bay Area landscape to be designed by Stanford University's arborist. [13] The building thus becomes the capsule the beehive the phalanstery for 15000 engineers circling the wagons against the outsourcing of Californian design. Apple had thus become the new Californian "machine" reproducing local tastes and predispositions even through its immigrant employees like the British designer Jonathan Ive or the German Esslinger and his practice frogdesign all of whom were required to relocate to the region as part of their association with Jobs. Even the design presence of Baron Foster whose ideas were profoundly affected by his admiration of the Case Study houses does nothing to deflect the broad synthetic Californianism of Apple's trajectory. Yet ultimately Jobs's phenomenology can be founded on certainties of place and language no more than the modern-day Bay Area can be founded on certainties of place and language. It is a light phenomenology slickly tuning consciousness through sensory experience. [14] This calibration of affect surely at Job's behest explains how Bohlin Cywinski Jackson effortlessly switched from the vernacular brick and iron opacity at Pixar to the Zen-like transparency of the 2006 Manhattan Apple Store. Opacity transparency Jungian forms materials place tectonics: Jobs and his collaborators were trying to access phenomenological truths at the office and at the store.Top: Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Apple store Fifth Avenue New York 2006. [Photo by Jorge Láscar] Bottom: Early graphical user interface Xerox Star 1981. [Via DigiBarn Computer Museum] Along the way Jobs conscripted the very typology of the window from the Graphical User Interface - which he explored soon after it was invented at Xerox PARC in Palo Alto - to the service of his light phenomenology that sought to reveal the world. Floor-to-ceiling windows beloved by Bay Region architects became the central motif of Jobs's inventions - from the computers to the phones to the stores the windowed grids of the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue relaying attention to the windowed tablets relaying attention to windowed operating systems propelling us steadily out of history. Though routinely described asiconic Apple products seem actually to be moving away from idiosyncratic forms like the trend-setting colored-jellybean style of the late '90s iMac series. The aluminum glass and radius edges of the recent products strain for ascetic neutrality. Without much difficulty the Apple consumer could imagine information one day floating in the environment dematerialized into the "cybernetic meadow" forecast in the celebrated (if ridiculed) 1967 poetry collection by San Franciscan Richard Brautigan when he was poet-in-residence at Caltech. [15] So at the end of his life Jobs settled on a Zen-like approach as the appropriate phenomenological architecture for information technology just as a Zen-like transcendence had attracted generations of Bay Region aesthetes. Bay Region Style itself bore the clear imprint of Japanese Zen architecture. In a famous 1947 essay on "Bay Region Style" Lewis Mumford described the style as "a product of the meeting of the Occidental and Oriental architectural traditions" [16] and six decades later Steve Jobs concurred: "I have always found … Japanese Zen Buddhism … to be aesthetically sublime." [17] "Zen is to California as Greece is to Germany": so an uncommonly insightful student quipped to me recently bridging the Bay Region's dogged pursuit of higher consciousness and the German phenomenological tradition. [18] Jobs's seemingly existential understanding of design does indeed remind one of the fascination exerted over architects by Martin Heidegger for whom design functioned best in the background the better to "bring forth" Being. Bay Area and German existentialism are even linked by a proud sense of their higher provincialism the disdain for metropolitan affectation. [19] William Wurster referring to the Bay Region Style wrote in 1956 that "Architecture is not a goal. Architecture is for life and pleasure and work and for people. The picture frame not the picture." [20] Jobs enthused about the Bay Area's mid-century stick-built houses developed by Joseph Eichler: Eichler's "houses were smart and cheap and good" Jobs told Walter Isaacson. "I love it when you can bring really great design and simple capability to something that doesn't cost too much. … It was the original vision for Apple." [21] And so we have that paradox that the normative or the provincial comes to embody rarefied taste and so occupy a central place in design culture. (Something similar happened with critical regionalism.) [22] By the early 21st century Apple products were the summary forms of international modern design recalling the abstemiousness of Viennese architect and journalist Adolf Loos at the turn of the 20th century of the German industrial design of the Dessau Bauhaus of the 1920s and of the Braun products of Dieter Rams in the 1960s admiration for the latter of which Jobs developed when attending the Aspen Institute's conferences in the early 1980s. [23]Top: Eichler home original advertisement. [Via Architizer] Bottom: Dieter Rams Braun radio and record player. [Photos by Nite Owl left and Toby Evans right]3. Thinking inside the boxWhat did it mean for Jobs to attempt to recuperate "normative" "classically" modernist values for a postmodern late capitalist world order - for a world order whose anguish seems better captured by the old-world Koolhaas and in which modernism's promise of emancipation is trammeled in the off-shore factories of Apple's manufacturers? Is this nothing but a travesty of modernism? For of course we know that aesthetic culture is at best a poor substitute indeed for truly political society and a sickening lie in its absence. [24] The clamshell form of the late '90s MacBook was redolent of the sort of cigarette case that Loos identified in 1908 as the touchstone of modern culture: stripped portable repetitive. [25] Ornament became Crime in Jobs's mind as it had in Loos's. The Mac and the cigarette case were trade objects emblematic of their respective epochs their meanings indefinite not predetermined: as a content-producing machine the Mac strenuously obliges society with cultural "running-room." Yet the aluminum sheathed MacBook is not quite the quintessential Loosian object. It is almost too refined for its purposes courting the status of a commodity fetish mystifying and objectifying human relations through its market exchange. The MacBook confuses the urn with the chamber pot to borrow Loos's terms; it struggles to distinguish the ceremonial from the functional. It ennobles the rituals of everyday life like writing email but it is too slick to disrupt our lived continuum which for Loos was the critical function of art architecture and language - a way in which to make sense of our world. So it is to Rem Koolhaas and his firm OMA that we must turn for manifestation of the disjunctions of tradition and modernity of place and space. The contrast in taste in aesthetics between Jobs and Koolhaas is illustrated most obviously by comparing the two headquarters buildings. With its twisting and grotesque form the China Central Television tower underscores the tragic deterioration of the public sphere as the production of information is impressed into the service of the capitalist dictatorship of the People's Republic. It is practically a Salon work of art simultaneously repulsive and fascinating politically and aesthetically in a way that reminds me of that classic of the Salon genre Théodore Géricault's The Raft of the Medusa (1818–1819). [26] Whereas the Apple HQ suggests a very different version of the Romantic legacy of the recovery of a primordial reason beyond intellectualization - it strains to be "insanely great" in Jobs's famous phrase. The circle of steel and glass suggests no history no past; its gesture is spontaneous or Jungian or Zen childlike in its simplicity and secrecy. It needs no interpretation because as designer Sean Daly blogged in The Architects' Newspaper:,The ensō or "circle" is perhaps the most enduring motif in the Zen tradition one that first appears in Japanese monasteries in the mid-1600s. The Zen circle is not a linguistic character but rather a symbol that conveys a host of things - the universe the cyclical nature of existence enlightenment strength and poised contemplation. It suggests the Heart Sutra which explains that "form is void and void is form" … [27],Like Pixar in Emeryville Apple in Cupertino exemplifies a light phenomenology. It's Zen kitsch. Jobs's Zen postmodernism of which Foster's building is an embodiment acts upon the world through process intervening in a cybernetic cycle for which the record of historical struggle is but a dysfunctional footnote. In sharp contrast the tragic postmodernism of Koolhaas and the CCTV feels jagged a beauty of terribilità.Top: Norman Foster Apple headquarters Cupertino California projected 2015. Middle and Bottom: Rem Koolhaas/OMA China Central TV headquarters Beijing 2012. [Photos by Jim Gourley]Koolhaas's abstraction of modernity appeals more to critical tastes than Jobs's interactionwith modernity. It is almost as though Koolhaas courts his appeal to art-historical criticality even contributing to its veritable organ October. [28] Koolhaas who clearly rejected "interactive" and "gadgety" design - as a young architect at the Architectural Association in London in the '70s he had little use for the Archigram influence - seems to think like an art historian and his relative lack of name recognition in the broader culture perhaps confirms the discernment of the specialists. Whereas the outpouring of grief over Jobs's death was often in questionable taste. "It sounds crazy" a student in my modern architecture class said the day after Jobs died "but for people of my age it's like we lost our Bobby Kennedy." Could my students be so lacking in discrimination? Perhaps … but perhaps not. I would be fuming if that student had responded in the same way to say the untimely passing of Mark Zuckerberg. No disrespect but Zuckerberg is we might agree no Kennedy. So maybe we might agree as well that my student was simply one of many seeking inspiration as an Obama administration elected upon the promise of hope struggled to the end of its third tumultuous year. And apparently she found it: I noticed her in the crowd when Occupy arrived at my university campus not long after Jobs's death. One of the few commentators to understand the strange politics of the mourning of Jobs was Frank Rich. Writing for New York MagazineRich compared Jobs to Edison as an inventor-entrepreneur whose American technological "architecture" (so to speak) was constructive to the same extent that the upstart American financial-services "architecture" - of the type built by the GE Capital division that had eclipsed the GE industrial division founded by Edison in the 1890s - was destructive. "Some on the right were baffled that the ostensible Marxists demonstrating in lower Manhattan would observe a moment of silence and assemble makeshift shrines for a top one-percenter like Jobs whose expensive products were engineered for near-instant obsolescence and produced by Chinese laborers in factories with substandard health-and-safety records" said Rich. But he continued: ,If you love your Mac and iPod you can still despise CDOs and credit-default swaps. Jobs's genius - in the words of Regis McKenna a Silicon Valley marketing executive who worked with him early on- was his ability "to strip away the excess layers of business design and innovation until only the simple elegant reality remained." The supposed genius of modern Wall Street is the exact reverse piling on excess layers of business and innovation on ever thinner and more exotic creations until simple reality is distorted and obscured.,The paradox was also understood more viscerally by that bellwether of campus humor The Onion: ,Steve Jobs the visionary co-founder of Apple Computers and the only American in the country who had any clue what the fuck he was doing died Wednesday at the age of 56. "We haven't just lost a great innovator leader and businessman we've literally lost the only person in this country who actually had his shit together and knew what the hell was going on" a statement from President Barack Obama read in part adding that Jobs will be remembered both for the life-changing products he created and for the fact that he was able to sit down think clearly and execute his ideas - attributes he shared with no other U.S. citizen.,Sit down think clearly and execute ideas: this is what draws students to design in a postmodern age yes? "Obama added" (according to The Onion) "that if anyone could fill the void left by Jobs it would probably be himself but said that at this point he honestly doesn't have the slightest notion what he's doing anymore."Bohlin Cywinski Jackson Apple store North Michigan Ave Chicago 2003. [Photo by Almond Dhukka]We might decry the chirping of an Occupier's iPhone as a mere simulacrum of political society. We might better see the fate of political society in the metaphor of Koolhaas's atolls of beauty and social space cast adrift in a neoliberal world. But by a remarkable historical turn the Pollyanna-ish aesthetic of the Apple Mac has forced us back (somewhat) to actual political society to actual consumer-political activity. What R. John Williams has called Californian Techne-Zen was articulated so forcefully by Apple that it has seemingly necessitated its own exposure as a false consciousness. [29] Millions of consumers seem to have understood instinctively an incongruity between Apple's aesthetic triumph and its refusal to advance social justice: it failed our expectation that advanced bourgeois art will articulate or resolve contradiction. Instead the iPhone starkly verified the dichotomy of its slogan "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China": capitalist differentials in land and labor value exclude millions from the Bay-Area nation. In so nearly sublimating the contradiction Jobs's art drew attention to the contradiction. Jobs's electronics were so beguiling that their users were forced into a classic bourgeois visceral encounter with guilt contradiction tragedy: it was this that finally confirmed Jobs as an architect-provocateur on a par with Koolhaas. Both are indeed Salon designers ageless enfant terribles and lightning rods prompting and giving shape to otherwise formless feelings and debates. Still nobody seems to be holding Koolhaas responsible for the work conditions of his building contractors or steel millers though the unnatural and monumental gesture of CCTV did indeed draw attention to the furtive modes of production - the state censorship - of Chinese information. When it was occupying its old building (whatever it was) I had never heard of CCTV nor paused to consider its role in censorship. And when I was using a Dell laptop the working conditions enforced in China by Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn were remote from my awareness even though Foxconn supplied Dell and practically every other electronics manufacturer of which I am a customer. Was it preordained one wonders in retrospect that Jobs's iPad - which he loved to point at the front page of The New York Times during his famous new product presentations - would deliver New York Times reports about the wage and health and safety scandals in the Shenzhen factories in which the apparatus was made? I used my MacBook Air to sign a petition demanding that Apple redress Foxconn worker grievances. Every keystroke on the superlative machine reminded me of my desire for a better world for a more complete and transparent political architecture and of my complicity with forces I prefer to imagine as beyond my control. To borrow the terms popularized by anthropologist Bruno Latour the works of both Jobs and Koolhaas function as "things" in and around which are assembled public "concerns" that might otherwise slip through the net of parliamentary discourses arrayed around both left and right. [30] Even the Wall Street Journal felt compelled to question the "secular prophecy" of technological salvation wrought by Jobs. [31] Apple and OMA objects succeed as works of art and also as catalysts of public attention not just by being so astonishingly outré but also by picturing the world unexpectedly - in extreme resolution in extreme disjunction - and then by suggesting a means to interpret our existence in the world.Top: Taiwanese protestors outside Foxconn (Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.) headquarters in New Taipei 2010.

The varieties of bourgeois experience I don't want to muddy the waters of judgment as a caprice. My purpose is to draw attention to the way that art-historical judgment thinks in several registers about design that works in several registers in a world that operates in countless registers. To an art historian the minimalism of the 2006 Manhattan Apple Store is evocative of European Rationalism and neo-Platonism when to many other cultural critics it is simply an extravagant warehouse a shop composed of nothing but shop windows. But now watch how Jobs and Koolhaas complicate the relation between value and values (between exchange value and human value) in similar ways by thinking like art historians. "Great products" Jobs told The New York Times are triumphs of "taste" derived from "study observation and being steeped in the culture of the past and present." [32] OMA designs one of its best buildings for Prada and Apple amasses $70 billion in cash. Both insist that we pay attention to the art of shopping but then shun the pursuit of business for its own sake. [33] Koolhaas's studio at Harvard studied shopping with delicious paradox [34] and Jobs saw himself as the nemesis of Michael Dell's fixation with the bottom line. No part of Apple's organization would ever be "junkspace." Their work invites a moral response and Jobs and Koolhaas pass onto us their consumers and interpreters the responsibility to square their contradictions. Jobs and Koolhaas alike chose the role of eyewitness to the student uprisings in Berkeley and Paris in 1968 and for each the activism of the Sixties would be formative; years later each would be content to observe the political responses to their work in the '90s and '00s with similar remove. These two modes of architectural ambition interactive and abstract Californian and European are not categorically different modes - the one in a naïve or affirmative association with capitalism say the other in a critical relationship - but are two sides of the same coin. Jobs and Koolhaas each project variants of postmodern modernism: one optimistic but quietly doomed the other doomed but quietly optimistic. The reason of course is that design (like art) is pretty much inevitably a dialectic between God and Wall Street. The Occupier's iPhone. The Eichler House. The double bind built simultaneously of OMA's two West Coast projects: the Seattle Public Library and the Prada Epicenter in Los Angeles (both 2004). Enlightenment and shopping. Oscillating between Soviet constructivism Manhattanite cosmopolitanism and commercial midcentury modernism Koolhaas reminds us that at the very moment that modern design triumphed its utopian political project was doomed. Meaning that questions about Steve and Rem are ultimately questions about us. What more literal object lessons could we ask for as art historians standing in front of our students than OMA's CCTV and Apple's Campus 2? One abstracts the agony of the European public sphere its workers eking out a living in a Chinese capitalist dictatorship while the other promises an interactive Californianism after the near-eclipse of the New Deal. The university design studios of the Great Recession rather than transcending the dialectic are rather merging abstraction and interactivity producing student projects that routinely integrate buildings with transgressive spaces sites economies nutrition mapping. Given the questionable origins of our own paychecks it's a devil's bargain that few art historians can evade for long. Something of the Shenzhen "disgrace" of Jobs might reciprocally be carried over to art history which is adept at using the abstractions of critical theory to describe the complicity of buildings and architects with economic regimes but most often shies away from any explicit description of the deep connections that bind architecture to labor and poverty.

[Photo by Corbin Keech]Architecture is a lifeworld within which none of us can parse absolute judgments yet it still offers ethical and actionable bearings. This I hope I am illustrating precisely by comparing two of its most notorious architects: the fascination of design is exactly its hermeneutic potential for thinking and working from the inside across several registers. We can study the varieties of advanced bourgeois thinking that constitute and shape architecture as it re-combines - and reconciles [?] - base economic determination with the factors of geography language desire technology materials. Much as we return to other moments in the history of capital accumulation - Florence in the 15th century Holland in the 17th century Manhattan in the 19th century - and detect something mortal about their arcades portraiture and still lives so we can imagine art historians of the future scrutinizing the ambitions of OMA and Apple. One day the Bay Region will make for a particularly intriguing study in New Deal systems-driven and neoliberal art history the Golden Gate Bridge an analog of Brunelleschi's Dome a place awash with new money fusing science technology engineering and learning humans and gods an outpost of godly and economic universalism at the center of a trade network. We can already see the next chapters getting written; Elon Musk is the latest guru. It is pointless to try and demote Musk's wild gamble on the Tesla electric car his fantastic ambition to save the world one drive-train at a time his thinking across scales (the roadside rest and recharge stations his concomitant interest in internet commerce and space exploration) the "insanely great" quality of his early products his commitment to the Bay Area (to the point of locating his factories there) as an instance of business as usual. His products imply a cultural program beyond the marketplace. Musk compels public discussion. He's a sort of architect. Looking at California in this way points back to older iconological approaches art historical analyses applied across objects and institutions ecologies and economies of dissimilar scale type intention moving beyond connoisseurship and critical readings to capture something of the intellectual ecology behind things - the epistemology or ontology; more than just the study of ideology the study of ideas and intellectual frameworks particular to design to its active attempts to mold the immediate future and to its presuppositions about the world and the way it works. That things don't just happen that political economy and subjectivity aren't givens; that the meeting of matter and consciousness can be altered is not a general understanding but one particular to a class educated in design. At which point I might be able to take my students out of the lecture hall (where we study OMA's staggering and faraway monuments) and attempt an architectural exegesis of the systems of the Central Valley scouring it for meaning agency interruption rather than celebrating it as a vernacular or damning it as pure instrumentalism. Perhaps we can stand above Cupertino and regard it like the heroine in Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 (1965) who observes a new town a little further south in California: ,Like many named places in California it was less an identifiable city than a grouping of concepts - census tracts special purpose bond-issue distracts shopping nuclei all overlaid with access roads to its own freeway … a plinth course of capital on which everything afterward had been built however rickety or grotesque toward the sky. … she thought of the first time she'd opened a transistor radio to replace a battery and seen her first printed circuit. The ordered swirl of houses and streets … sprang at her now with the same unexpected astonishing clarity as the circuit card had. … there were to both outward patterns a hieroglyphic sense of concealed meaning of an intent to communicate. … [A] revelation … trembled just beyond the threshold of her understanding … she and the Chevy seemed parked at the center of an odd religious instant.

I'm enormously pleased to say that a book project long in the making will finally see the light of day later this month a collaboration between ACTAR and the Nevada Museum of Art called Landscape Futures: Instruments Devices and Architectural Inventions. On a related note I'm also happy to say simply despite the painfully slow pace of posts here on the blog going back at least the last six months or so that many projects ticking away in the background are at long last coming to fruition including Venue and now the publication of Landscape Futures.[Images: The opening spreads of Landscape Futures; book design by Everything-Type-Company].Landscape Futures both documents and continues an exhibition of the same name that ran for a bit more than six months at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno from August 2011 to February 2012. The exhibition was my first solo commission as a curator and by far the largest project I had worked on to that point. It was an incredible opportunity and I remain hugely excited by the physical quality and conceptual breadth of the work produced by the show's participating artists and architects.  Best of all I was able to commission brand new work from many of the contributors including giving historian David Gissen a new opportunity to explore his ideas-on preservation technology and the environmental regulation of everyday urban space-in a series of wall-sized prints; finding a new genre-a fictional travelogue from a future lithium boom-for architects David Benjamin and Soo-in Yang of The Living in which to experiment; and setting aside nearly an entire room the centerpiece of the 2500-square-foot exhibition for an immensely complicated piece of functioning machinery (plus documentary photographs posters study-models an entire bound book of research and much else besides) by London-based architects Smout Allen a design duo I refer to often here on BLDGBLOG.  Those works joined pre-existing projects by Mason White & Lola Sheppard of Lateral Office and InfraNet Lab whose project "Next North/The Active Layer" explored the emerging architectural conditions presented by climate-changed terrains in the far north; Chris Woebken & Kenichi Okada whose widely exhibited "Animal Superpowers" added a colorful note to the exhibition's second room; and architect-adventurer Liam Young who brought his "Specimens of Unnatural History" successfully through international customs to model the warped future ecosystem of a genetically-enhanced Galapagos. Needless to say I am absolutely thrilled with the incredible design work done by Everything-Type-Company-a new and rapidly rising design firm based in Brooklyn founded by Kyle Blue and Geoff Halber-and I am also over the moon to think that this material will finally be out there for discussion elsewhere. It's been a long long time in the making.  In any case shipping should begin later this month. Hopefully the above glimpses and the huge list of people whose graphic textual or conceptual work is represented in the book will entice you to support their effort with an order.

But for the last decade the Chinese–who recently surpassed Americans as the biggest consumers of luxury goods–have picked up the mantle of logo-mania. But that may be changing now as the Chinese luxury customer's taste is becoming a bit more discerning.,A study by Bain and Company reported by Business of Fashion found that Chinese shoppers in the nation's prosperous cities are starting to move away from obvious logos. "Chinese shoppers in Beijing and Shanghai are now truly global luxury consumers" the study's authors note. "They are shifting away from typical emerging market preference for logos and other visible signs of luxury spending and shifting to a global mindset of uniqueness high-quality and understatement in luxury items.",Logos are still popular outside of major cities–the study found that "55 percent of consumers outside of Beijing and Shanghai say they will buy more products showing logos"–but China's cosmopolitan shoppers are looking for a more discreet brand of luxury.,And purveyors of logo-laden goods are taking note. LVMH's Bernard Arnault had already made it clear on an earnings call in January that in the face of the company's slowest growth of reveunue since 2009 it would "focus on more luxurious materials and reduce the visibility of its monogrammed products" according to Business of Fashion. This is more about maintaining the brand's exclusivity and prestige than it is about making money. "Of course it would be easier for Louis Vuitton to boost its revenue; all it would take would be to launch ten new products with the monogram product but down the road it's not a good strategy" Arnault said.,While Louis Vuitton's spring 2013 runway was one huge homage to the house's signature Damier check for fall 2013 there was nothing that screamed 'Louis Vuitton'. In the show notes Marc Jacobs wrote "The house's Monogram and Damier canvas are nowhere to be seen on the catwalk.",Presumably the shift in consumer attitudes in the Far East will provide more opportunities for less logo-dependent luxury brands–like Proenza Schouler–to perform well in China. (On a personal note my husband thinks the PS1 bag looks like "something the IT guy at my office carries." Doesn't get more stealth-luxury than that!) It will be interesting to see how logos will be incorporated into luxury goods in the next few years.,Continue reading ,http://bit.ly/10J4rC1, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashionista,fashion,logos, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjkanzW7jt1s75lgto1_250.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:YjhshL, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This year Google says it's broadening the scope of that effort with the new Art Copy & Code project which is described as a series of experiments combining creative pros ad agencies and brands to see how branded advertising might also become useful tools for consumers.,The 'adverapp' (see what I did there?) Google has created to kick off this project is called "Smileage" and it's a Volkswagen-branded Android app. It incorporates themes from Volkswagen's 2012 advertising campaign and acts as a trip journal that measures things like weather traffic location distance social interaction and more to create an automatic live interactive map of your road trip. The app is powered by Google+'s new sign-in capabilities and can aggregate photos and videos taken by you and your fellow road-trippers to add them to map. Smileage works with any car not just VWs.,Apps like HipGeo already do similar things but this does look to add some unique functionality via the ability to use input from multiple participants and the Google+ integration. It actually looks like it could be a fun app to use in fact and that appears to be the entire point of this new Art Copy & Code project.,Mobile advertising is an entirely different beast from desktop web ads and worlds away from traditional print/video media marketing. Google has been described as having a "mobile advertising problem" because of the the low quality of clicks coming from mobile relative to the desktop. In order to get around that it has to innovate and create experiences mobile users are more likely to engage with.,Something like Smileage might just do the trick. It's part service content part tool and part advertising in a standalone destination. The point is to create something that users will want to go to independently – Volkswagen is building a desirable product in order to help make its other products more desirable instead of simply trying to highlight its cars through ads that offer no actual value to mobile users.,Smileage is launching soon and accepting beta sign-ups now. Seem familiar? It's how startups often generate hype for their own upcoming products. Is this the future of mobile advertising? At this point it's just an early-stage experiment but if it works out it very well could be.,(via Google Shows Off Its New 'Adverapp' Concept A Volkswagen-Branded Road Trip Journal | TechCrunch), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,google,advertising,adverapp,volkswagen,automotive, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjkwomYHEe1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:module-share.jpg?w=555&h=415, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But it could easily migrate downstairs three floors to "Applied Design" a show of works from MoMA's design collection that opened on Saturday and will be on view through January 2014.,Organized by Paola Antonelli senior curator of architecture and design at the museum with Kate Carmody a curatorial assistant and Paul Galloway supervisor of the museum's Study Center "Applied Design" is a bold bracketing of furnishings tools graphics and games that challenge what we imagine design to be. Unlike the streamlined chairs automobiles and utensils that are staples of MoMA's collection most of the roughly 100 items displayed here will never be found on eBay. But you can see them in video arcades and biotechnology labs and even on the keypads of communications devices.,Ms. Antonelli has roamed this unconventional turf in previous MoMA shows. "Design and the Elastic Mind" (2008) for instance explored the productive partnership between design and science in works like BioWall a lacy fiberglass partition by the London design studio Loop.pH which was formed from mathematically derived shapes and woven with living plants. "Talk to Me" (2011) opened a window onto the increasingly complicated relationship between people and machines; its many engrossing examples included the Artificial Biological Clock designed by Revital Cohen a prototype for a device that collates online data from a woman's doctor therapist and bank manager to determine the right time for her to have a child.,Both of these works can be found in "Applied Design" where they are cleanly displayed and easier to study than in the rich thickets of their prior installations. They are joined not just by companions from those earlier shows but also by other recent additions to the permanent collection.,In an audacious stroke Ms. Antonelli acquired 14 video games for the museum last fall including Pac-Man Tetris Myst and Canabalt. They're installed in housings of utter sobriety along three walls of this exhibition. Visitors are invited to play several of the games and watch samples of the elaborate digital worlds constructed over time in others.,And posted at the rear of the gallery is the "@" symbol which Ms. Antonelli brought to MoMA with much fanfare two years ago. The mark dates at least from the Middle Ages and was long used by merchants notating orders of commercial goods sold at a particular price. What MoMA "owns" is a typographical version of the symbol adopted by Ray Tomlinson in 1971 while he was designing the first e-mail system developed by the United States government.,Ms. Antonelli is less interested in the form of the mark than its role in creating global networks. Like video games the @ symbol is our passport to enter the digital realm at the border between flesh and technology. Ms. Antonelli sees design potential in "the space between human and digital" she noted last week. This is the frontier of science fiction where bodies are augmented by empowering prosthetics - the scenarios of "The Six Million Dollar Man" and the 1999 David Cronenberg film "eXistenZ." Except Ms. Antonelli believes that such clumsy enhancements will ultimately evolve into a seamless interface between human and digital with the mind as controller.,If only the label "Applied Design" communicated the excitement of that vision. Usually Ms. Antonelli dreams up inspired titles for her shows but the name "Applied Design" is mysteriously drab and even redundant: design by almost any definition serves some practical end. What does "applied" mean for work that was always presumably intended for use?,Ms. Antonelli said she was thinking about a future when the design field will be subdivided like physics into theoretical and applied branches. (That future is within sight one should add; even now designers once known for creating cold hard objects are rebranding themselves as "innovation strategists" who produce ideas rather than things.) At the same time she said she was riffing on an old term for design: "applied art.",Fundamentally however the title refers to the many arenas in which designers are active. Ms. Antonelli hasn't abandoned the object but she is keen to show it as an outgrowth of open-ended technologies like 3-D printing and conceptual models like biomimicry where design is patterned on nature.,On view for example is the Lily Impeller a flowing hunk of stainless steel that Jayden D. Harman an inventor and entrepreneur modeled on the Fibonacci spiral. The shape which curls like a nautilus shell allows the device to circulate millions of gallons of water efficiently in municipal water systems.,It's a gorgeous object. "I want to remind people of the importance of elegance: the fact that beauty should not be costlier or harder to find than nonbeauty" Ms. Antonelli said of the many visually compelling displays in the show including lacy textiles from the Dutch studio Freedom of Creation made by rapid-prototyping technology and a floor lamp by the British designer Paul Cocksedge that is effectively a big fiber-optic strand. People who stop to admire such objects will be poised to think about "a world of very serious manufacturing and materials considerations" she said. "They seduce you with their form then transport you into the future of design.",And what if those seductions lead not to the future but to a dead end of artistic self-indulgence? The kind of object that looks better on paper (or in a museum setting) than in practice?,That's the charge against one of the star exhibits Mine Kafon an instrument designed to float across fields and detonate buried land mines. Created by Massoud Hassani an Afghan as a student project at Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands Mine Kafon would seem above reproach: it's made inexpensively of recycled materials; it's powered by a renewable energy source the wind; it promises to save lives; it can be easily repaired when damaged; and with its resemblance to a fluffy dandelion it's a visual poem. Sitting in the corner of an exhibition space it commands serious attention even without the accompanying video that shows it in action.,But Marc Vlemmings a journalist in the Netherlands is a critic of the invention. Debating its merits in the Dutch design magazine Items he argued that Mine Kafon is a prototype that hasn't been tested and refined sufficiently to earn its plaudits (not least of which is a place in MoMA's permanent collection). He was rankled by the premise of a minesweeper following an erratic wind-driven path rather than a systematic program for clearing the weapons. "The Mine Kafon provides inhabitants of a mine-infested area with a false sense of security" he said.,When told of the objection Ms. Antonelli countered: "Sometimes there are hero objects that sensitize the world. I never thought that it was tested and ready to be deployed but I thought that the concept was so strong so convincing and so powerful even because of the connection to the designer's personal history that it was enough for us.",Still the idea of heroic yet possibly ineffective design would have disturbed some of Ms. Antonelli's predecessors at MoMA. Much modern design is based on the principle that objects that perform wonderfully (whether paper clips or BMWs) can't help looking wonderful whereas objects that fail to work bear the aesthetic mark of their ineptitude.,History has proved this maxim wrong many times but never so persuasively as in the age of the computer chip when the relationship between appearance and performance has become increasingly irrelevant. Now tiny microprocessors govern the effectiveness of many designs. Form and function have undergone a rancorous divorce and frequently occupy separate quarters of the same objects.,But no matter what activity churns in the silicon brain of a design a museum exhibition is still compelled to make it appealing. If there are heroics in this show they lie in Ms. Antonelli's willingness to pursue design down slippery corridors into challenging places like molecular biology and five-dimensional space. Her interest in design as a response to new technologies and social conditions - a promoter of experience rather than an object to be passively considered even in the formal precincts of a museum - is in step with the way design is being executed in the world.,Ultimately she may expand the definition of design so far that it explodes but will that matter? She's calling a messy restless enthralling discipline exactly as she sees it. Maybe it's time to think of another name for design - or several.,,design,moma, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjm36l8VUB1s75lgto1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:07DETAILS_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1363124523-1c120.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1363124522-9841b.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1363124527-f343a.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The pieces whose postures indicate they are either on their death bed or very close are punctured with thousands of holes and then embedded with powerful LED lights creating an effect much like the one you get from a planetarium.,Ogaki is no stranger to morbid themes having analyzed the topic greatly in previous work. however this latest series is very much about life and the living individual. It is also the first time in her work that she uses the image of a human being. Life itself appears to radiate from the sculpture which at times almost appears to be a deity that holds the universe within it.,,,Born in Japan Ogaki went to art school in Japan. After graduating she moved to Germany where she spent over 10 years.

The wood goes through a metamorphosis process to become a new kind of skin.,Transforming wood making it possible that it not only could be flexible or soft but it could also behave exactly like a cloth was the idea behind the project.,To turn wood into fabric we had to break the continuity of its surface which we obtained by dividing it into pieces. Wood organised as in polygons was then coupled with the fabric which acts as a support and a binder at the same time.,This is how we created "Wooden Mesh" a compound – realised through a high-tech patented process – that combines a rigid material (parent material) to a flexible support (secondary material).,The goal was to move beyond the hand-crafted production to create an industrial product that had a more suitable cost for the market. This was possible thanks to the major contribution of Sintesi Laser and Alberto Martinuzzo founder of Albeflex and "father" of the soft wood. Now the two-dimensional surface of a piece of wood has been completely transformed to become as smooth and soft as fabric., http://bit.ly/XshhUD, , , , , , , , , , ,dezeen,material,wood,emilie chalcraft, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjlwz1LFNS1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_9.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_1.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_2.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_5.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_6.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_12.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_10.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_8.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_11.jpg, , , , , , , , , , ,

How you enhance the image you want people to believe in."  Hilary Koob-Sassen's disjointed and sci-fi scenario film Transcalar investment Vehicle will be integrated with Bryntesson's hooded figures.,Sabina Bryntesson S/S 13 collection presented at Fashion Scout,,Stills from Transcalar Investment Vehicles (2012) Hilary-Koob-Sassen,Sabina Bryntesson MA 2012 collection,……………………………………………………………………………………,Craig Green is perhaps the most advanced designer of this group of four having presented his second collection as part of MAN at London Collections Men.  His CSM MA collection which was again inspired by religion and cults as well as by the film The Village of the Damned lingers on in people's memories for its highly considered and abstracted questioning of uniforms and workwear.  Green's misshapen bodies will be paired with the straight grid-esque lines of Simon Payne's Point Line Plane video piece.  , Craig Green A/W 13-4 Collection,, Stills from Point Line Plane (2010) Simon Payne,style bubble,art,fashion,susie_bubble, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjm39uINMf1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WnItAM,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WnIqFl,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WnIqFn,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WnItAO,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WnIqFp,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s4xE,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s4xG,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s4xI,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s4xK,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s4xM,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6FY,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6G0,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Wg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Wi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Wk,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s7tn,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Wo,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Ws,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s7tp,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X7s6Ww

155,45308517417,2013-03-14 00:54:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45308517417/la-biennale-di-venezia-the-encyclopedic,photo, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,La Biennale di Venezia - The Encyclopedic Palace,On November 16 1955 self-taught Italian-American artist Marino Auriti filed a design with the U.S. Patent office depicting his Palazzo Enciclopedico (The Encyclopedic Palace) an imaginary museum that was meant to house all worldly knowledge bringing together the greatest discoveries of the human race from the wheel to the satellite.,Holed up in his garage out in the middle of the Pennsylvania countryside Auriti worked on his brainchild for years constructing the model of a 136-story building that would stand seven hundred meters tall and take up over sixteen blocks in Washington D.C.,Auriti's plan was never carried out of course but the dream of universal all-embracing knowledge crops up throughout the history of art and humanity as one that eccentrics like Auriti share with many other artists writers scientists and self-proclaimed prophets who have tried-often in vain-to fashion an image of the world that will capture its infinite variety and richness.,These personal cosmologies with their delusions of omniscience shed light on the constant challenge of reconciling the self with the universe the subjective with the collective the specific with the general the individual with the culture of her time. Today as we grapple with a constant flood of information such attempts to structure knowledge into all-inclusive systems seem even more necessary and even more desperate. The 55th International Art Exhibition explores these flights of the imagination in a show that-like Auriti's Encyclopedic Palace-combines contemporary artworks with historical artifacts and found objects.,With works spanning over the past century alongside several new commissions and with over one hundred and fifty artists from more than thirty-seven countries the exhibition is structured like a temporary museum that initiates an inquiry into the many ways in which images have been used to organize knowledge and shape our experience of the world.,Blurring the line between professional artists and amateurs outsiders and insiders the exhibition takes an anthropological approach to the study of images focusing in particular on the realms of the imaginary and the functions of the imagination. What room is left for internal images-for dreams hallucinations and visions-in an era besieged by external ones? And what is the point of creating an image of the world when the world itself has become increasingly like an image?The exhibition opens in the Central Pavilion with a presentation of Carl Gustav Jung's Red Book an illustrated manuscript that the famous psychologist worked on for over sixteen years. A collection of visions epiphanies and hallucinations Jung's Red Book ushers in a meditation on inner images and dreams that runs throughout the show.,The exhibition brings together many examples of artworks and figurative expressions that reveal approaches to visualizing knowledge through representations of abstract concepts and manifestations of supernatural phenomena. In the galleries of the Central Pavilion intertwined with works by contemporary artists are the abstract paintings of Hilma af Klint Augustin Lesage's symbolic interpretations of the universe the divinations of Aleister Crowley and the apocalyptic premonitions of Friedrich Schröder-Sonnenstern. The ecstatic gift drawings of Shaker communities transcribe divine messages while the drawings of shamans from the Solomon Islands are peopled by deities and demons that battle sharks and other sea creatures. The depiction of the invisible is a key theme of the show as evidenced in the cosmographies of both Guo Fengyi and Emma Kunz in the religious icons and danses macabres of Jean-Frédéric Schnyder and in the video work by Artur Zmijewski who filmed a group of blind people painting a world they cannot see. ,A similar sense of cosmic awe pervades many of the other works on display from Melvin Moti's films to Laurent Montaron's reflections on nature all the way to the sublime landscapes of Thierry De Cordier. The tiny ceramic dreamscapes of Ron Nagle the intricate floral patterns of Anna Zemánková the mental maps of Geta Bratescu and the painted palimpsests of Varda Caivano describe an inner world where natural forms overlap with imaginary presences. These secret links between microcosm and macrocosm also animate Marisa Merz's hieratic figures and Maria Lassnig's fleshly ones: both turn self-portraits and bodies into ciphers of the universe. ,The exercise of the imagination through writing and drawing is a recurring motif in the exhibition. Christiana Soulou brings to life the imaginary beings catalogued by Jorge Luis Borges while José Antonio Suárez Londoño translates into images the diaries of Franz Kafka. The rare stones collection of French writer Roger Caillois combines geology with mysticism while the esoteric blackboard diagrams by pedagogue Rudolf Steiner feverishly relate the idealist dream of grasping and conveying the universe as a whole. , "The Encyclopedic Palace" is a show about obsessions and about the transformative power of the imagination. The alternative worlds dreamed up by artists as diverse as Morton Bartlett James Castle Peter Fritz and Achilles Rizzoli are displayed alongside Shinro Ohtake's conglomerations of found images and Carl Andre's visual autobiography. The dynamic tensions between inside and outside inclusion and exclusion are the subject of works that explore the role of imagination in prisons (Rossella Biscotti) and in psychiatric hospitals (Eva Kotatkova). Other places of confinement real or fanciful are depicted by Walter Pichler who spent most of his life-which sadly came to an end in 2012-creating habitats for his sculptures as if they were living creatures from another planet. ,In the vast halls of the Arsenale the exhibition is organized as a progression from natural to artificial forms following the typical layout of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cabinets of curiosities. Just like Auriti's Palace these baroque proto-museums brought together man-made and natural wonders to construct visual compendia of the world through a science of elective affinities and magical sympathies. This associative process of knowledge through its heterogeneous ordering of objects and images draws interesting parallels between the wunderkammer and today's culture of hyper-connectivity. ,Catalogues collections and taxonomies form the basis for many works on view including J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere's photos Uri Aran's installations Kan Xuan's videos Shinichi Sawada's bestiaries and Matt Mullican's labyrinths. Pawel Althamer assembles a collective portrait with a series of eighty sculptures.,In the drawings of Stefan Bertalan Lin Xue and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh we find stubborn attempts to decipher the code of nature while the films of Gusmão and Paiva and photographs of Christopher Williams Eliot Porter and Eduard Spelterini examine ecosystems and landscapes with an infatuated gaze that longs to capture all the Earth's spectacles large and small. ,Yüksel Arslan illustrates the encyclopedia plates of an imaginary civilization that resembles a slightly warped version of humanity. The aspiration to create a magnum opus like Auriti's Palace that can contain and describe everything flows through Arslan's drawings as well as Robert Crumb's visual chronicle of the Book of Genesis Frédéric Bruly Bouabre's cosmogonies and the legends recounted by Papa Ibra Tall. Camille Henrot's recent video work studies the creation myths of different societies while the hundred clay sculptures of Fischli and Weiss offer a wry antidote to the romantic excesses of such sweeping visions of human history. ,Video works by Neïl Beloufa and Steve McQueen and paintings by Eugene Von Breunchenhein reflect various approaches to picturing the future while memory serves as the point of departure for Aurélien Froment Andra Ursuta and many other artists in the exhibition. ,At the center of the Arsenale is a curatorial project by Cindy Sherman-a show within the show made up of over two hundred works by more than thirty artists-which creates an imaginary museum of her own devising. Dolls puppets mannequins and idols cohabit with photos paintings sculptures religious insignia and drawings by prison inmates which together compose an anatomical theater in which to contemplate the role of images in the representation and perception of the self. ,Bodies and desires are also at the core of Hito Steyerl's cinematic investigation of the culture of hyper-visibility and the latest documentary from Sharon Hayes which presents a remake of Pier Paolo Pasolini's study of sexuality Comizi d'Amore.,Ryan Trecartin's volatile post-human bodies introduce the final section of the Arsenale where works by Yuri Ancarani Alice Channer Simon Denny Wade Guyton Channa Horwitz Mark Leckey Helen Marten Albert Oehlen Otto Piene James Richards Pamela Rosenkranz Stan VanDerBeek and others examine the blend of information spectacle and knowledge that is so characteristic of the digital era. ,As a contrast to the white noise of the information age an installation by Walter De Maria celebrates the mute gelid purity of geometry. Like all works by this legendary artist-a pioneering figure in conceptual minimal and Land Art-this abstract sculpture is the result of complex numerological calculations-a self-contained system in which the endless possibilities of the imagination are reduced to an extreme synthesis. ,Among the exhibition's outdoor installations and performances-which include John Bock Ragnar Kjartansson Marco Paolini Erik van Lieshout and others and extend to the very end of the Arsenale in the Giardino delle Vergini-are works that take on and transform the sixteenth-century Venetian tradition of the Theatres of the World visual allegories of the cosmos in which actors and temporary architectures were used to construct representations of the universe.,Through these pieces and many other works on view "The Encyclopedic Palace" emerges as an elaborate but fragile construction a mental architecture that is as fantastical as it is delirious. After all the biennale model itself is based on the impossible desire to concentrate the infinite worlds of contemporary art in a single place: a task that now seems as dizzyingly absurd as Auriti's dream., , , ,art,imagination,invisible,biennale, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjml6l9NPU1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This is no mere arrangement; instead Richter has absorbed Vivaldi's The Four Seasons into his own musical bloodstream. At first Richter followed the example of other works in the "Recomposed" series which re-mix existing recordings but he says "I wanted to open up the score on a note-by-note level and working with an existing recording was like digging a mineshaft through an incredibly rich seam discovering diamonds and not being able to pull them out. That became frustrating. I wanted to get inside the score at the level of the notes and in essence re-write it re-composing it in a literal way."Richter calculates that in the process he has discarded around three-quarters of Vivaldi's original. He opens with what he describes as "a dubby cloud which I've called Spring 0. It functions as a sort of prelude setting up an electronic ambient space for the first Spring movement to step into. I've used electronics in several movements subtle almost inaudible things to do withthe bass but I wanted certain moments to connect to the whole electronic universe that is so much part of our musical language today." Other resonances are no less unexpected: Richter describes part of the first movement of his Summer as "heavy music for the orchestra. It's relentless pulsed music which is a quality that contemporary dance music has; and perhaps I was also thinking about John Bonham's drumming. Then in the second movement of Autumn I asked the harpsichordist Raphael Alpermann to play in what is a rather old-fashioned way very regularly rather like a ticking clock. That was partly because I didn't want the harpsichord part to be attention-seeking but also because that style connects to various pop records from the 1970s where the harpsichord or Clavinet was featured including various Beach Boys albums and the Beatles' Abbey Road." Clearly Richter has brought his own frame of reference to the project. As he says "Vivaldi's music is made of regular patterns and that connects with post-minimalism which is one strand in the music that I write. That felt like a natural link but even so it was surprisingly difficult to navigate my way through it. At every point I had to work out how much is Vivaldi and how much is me. It was difficult but also rewarding because the raw material is so fascinating."Just as Richter's Seasons plays tricks with the way we hear Vivaldi's original so it also asks questions of the soloist Daniel Hope. "Violinists have Vivaldi's The Four Seasons hardwired in their brain. Daniel is likely to play the original I don't know how many times in a year and for him to have my parallel text going on in another part of his brain is a challenge. I think he did a wonderful job. He brought to it a deep engagement with the original but he was fully prepared to cut this new swathe through the text.", , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Weaver Wyss Institute Harvard University,Today's 3D printers are mostly able to produce homogeneous materials with the same properties throughout whereas natural materials often exhibit varying properties or "gradients". A silk worm for example is able to produce a cocoon with a tough exterior and soft interior by varying the density and pattern of the silk fibres it deposits.,"The worm rotates its head in 8-figure movements so as to allow for the distribution of silk its density its thickness and through these manipulations it controls its mechanical properties based on structural and environmental constraints" says Oxman. "For instance the inner layers of the cocoon are relatively soft while the outer layers of the cocoon are stiffer. The silkworm than varies the properties of silk according to function and can be considered the biological equivalent of a mobile 3D multi-material printer.",The Silk Pavilion will be built using digital fabrication technologies at MIT's Media Lab. It will be installed on 22 April and will measure around 12 feet by 12 feet.,Oxman believes that freeform printing using robotic arms has more potential for architecture than existing 3D printing systems which use gantries that can only move in three directions and which require complex support structures to be printed at the same time to prevent the building components collapsing under their own weight.,"In traditional 3D printing the gantry-size poses an obvious limitation; it is defined by three axes and typically requires the use of support material both of which are limiting for the designer who wishes to print in larger scales and achieve structural and material complexity" explains Oxman. "Once we place a 3D printing head on a robotic arm we free up these limitations almost instantly.",In the future buildings may be constructed by swarms of tiny robots she says. "I would argue that 3D printing is more than anything an approach for organizing material. When considered in this way it is possible to move beyond the technology and its current limitations into larger scale constructions with geometrical and material complexity.",Oxman believes material limitations can be overcome by printing with responsive materials (which she calls "4D printing"); gantry limitations can be overcome by printing using multiple interactive robot-printers ("swarm construction"); and process limitations can be overcome by moving from layering to weaving in 3D space using a robotic arm (she calls this "CNC weaving").,Oxman believes that in the immediate future 3D printing in construction scales can only be successful if it is to challenge traditional construction techniques while being sensitive to cultural contexts.,She adds: "Transcending the scale limitation by using larger gantries can only offer so much; but if we consider swarm construction or rebar-integrated printing we are truly pushing building construction into the 21stcentury". Mediated Matter group research assistant Steven Keating is investigating these possibilities.,The CNSilk Pavilion is being developed by the Mediated Matter group at the MIT Media Lab in collaboration with Professor Fiorenzo Omenetto atTUFTS University and Dr. James Weaver at the WYSS Institute at Harvard University.,Researchers at the Mediated Matter Group developing this work include Markus Kayser Jared Laucks Carlos David Gonzalez Uribe Jorge Duro-Royo and Michal Firstenberg (Mediated Matter MIT Media Lab).,Note: a version of this story was first published on 6 March.

Vandevorst and Sharon Wauchob are dab hands at PFW and the likes of Gareth Pugh and Anthony Vaccarello are as this Business of Fashion piece points out designers who can essentially show on their own without the help of an initiative like MADE and get sponsorship elsewhere.  That said bringing them into a sumptuous space like the intimate salons of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothshild was a thrilling experience for different reasons.  I'm merely reviewing the MADE concept so I'll leave out the specifics of the collections for now.  Finally we were able to see Vaccarello's technical prowess up close in a show context and see all that oozing leather melding into well-judged hardware.  Likewise Gareth Pugh's finale of bing bag couture could be be better appreciated when they were fluttering by 40cm away from my vantage point.   ,Anthony Vaccarello images from Bureau Betak blog (really fantastic showcase for their show production work by the way),Gareth Pugh show photography Jacques Habbah for Dazed Digital,I didn't get to see Yang Li's presentation but this London-based designer made a confident presentation debut concentrating on refined double-faced textiles and dramatic lengths.  , ,……………………………………………………………………………………,I was excited to go and see the French knitwear trio Piece D'Anarchive whose work I've actually never seen before in person but I had interviewed for a piece in Elle UK.  They're all about French savoir-faire and the projections of knitting looms and an installation of yarn spools emphasised that.  Models flitted in and out with the outfits on but we

masked mannequins.  I'm a great admirer of the quiet but powerful sensibility of this Serbian-born Milan-based designer.  His are the type of clothes that can be arranged in a static installation free for all to contemplate his astute choice of fabrics and comfortable yet dramatic silhouettes.  It certainly fed the tactile desire to touch his clothes.  ,,,,,……………………………………………………………………………………,LA-based

ground for designers not based in Paris at all.  ,,style bubble,fashion,susie_bubble, , , , , , , , , , , ,

151,45349890999,2013-03-14 16:36:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45349890999/has-logo-fatigue-reached-a-tipping-point-paris,photo, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Has Logo Fatigue Reached a Tipping Point?,PARIS France - At last week's Louis Vuitton show all eyes were on Kate Moss as she walked down the runway in a long-sleeved embroidered tulle dress and a choppy short black wig. But while the Croydon-born supermodel was certainly attention-grabbing a more interesting surprise was tucked into the show notes that awaited each guest. There hidden between celebrations of the house's savoir faire and high quality materials was this sentence penned by Vuitton's creative director Marc Jacobs: "The house's Monogram and Damier canvas are nowhere to be seen on the catwalk.",Especially in light of last season's Vuitton showing inspired by the label's signature two-tone checkerboard known as Damier the disownment of two of the brand's most recognisable visual signifiers seemed like an about-face. But rather than being a seasonal whim on Jacobs' part the shift reflects a new strategy outlined earlier this year by the designer's boss Bernard Arnault chairman and chief executive of LVMH the luxury conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton.,After the fashion and leather goods company which accounts for more than half of LVMH's profits reported for the second quarter in a row its slowest growth in revenue since 2009 Arnault said on an earnings call in January that the brand would open fewer stores focus on more luxurious materials and reduce the visibility of its monogrammed products.,"Of course it would be easier for Louis Vuitton to boost its revenue; all it would take would be to launch ten new products with the monogram product but down the road it's not a good strategy" he said.,But what does it mean when the world's largest luxury brand shifts its focus away from the very trademarks on which its success has been built? Clearly Louis Vuitton has detected that some of its customers are tiring of the brand's increasingly ubiquitous 'LV' monogram and its equally familiar Damier begging a question with wide-ranging ramifications for the sector.,Has luxury logo fatigue reached a tipping point?,As LVMH generates 28 percent of its sales in Asia (excluding Japan) according to the group's annual results it's not surprising that Vuitton's strategic reorientation is inextricably linked to shifting consumption habits in China.,To be clear the logo-loving Chinese consumer hasn't disappeared and still accounts for a significant portion of revenue. According to Bain & Company's 'Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study' published in cooperation with Italian luxury goods trade association Altagamma "Consumers in China remain focused on conspicuous logos. Fifty-five percent of consumers outside of Beijing and Shanghai say they will buy more products showing logos." Similarly a recent survey by the Hurun Report identified Vuitton as the top preferred brand when it comes to gifting by wealthy Chinese men.,But the rise of a more discerning consumer who eschews blatant brand signifiers is putting new pressure on brands like Louis Vuitton to adapt their communications strategies and product assortments. "Chinese shoppers in Beijing and Shanghai are now truly global luxury consumers. They are shifting away from typical emerging market preference for logos and other visible signs of luxury spending and shifting to a global mindset of uniqueness high-quality and understatement in luxury items" according to the Bain study.,"Luxury in China is now about being 'in the know' versus being 'in the show'" said Bruno Lannes a Bain partner in Greater China and lead author of the Chinese edition of the study. "Changes in what Chinese shoppers want are now a central issue for the global luxury sector's largest brands.",Of course logo fatigue is not new. Nor is it unique to China. The phenomenon swept over Japan Europe and the US long before emerging in less developed markets. In the 1990s the 'LV' monogram was highly popular in American and European cities but slowly drifted away (often relegated to the provinces) as more savvy and demanding consumers sought out less obvious brand signifiers like iconic shapes or signature design treatments - Chanel's quilting for example - that only a select like-minded minority would recognise.,By 2001 logo fatigue was pervasive enough in the West to power the rise of 'stealth luxury' brands like Bottega Veneta which over the last decade grew from a small family-run enterprise to a global powerhouse driving over $1 billion-plus sales.,But in the last few years even companies like Gucci which continued to rely heavily on logo-ed products well into the 2000s have changed direction. In 2010 François-Henri Pinault chairman and chief executive of PPR which owns Gucci told WWD "Our groups are moving toward fewer logos more discreet luxury. It's a question of adapting our ranges very rapidly to this new perception of luxury a luxury which is more subtle more sophisticated which is what we are doing.",Conventional wisdom however said that conspicuous logos would remain desirable in emerging markets like China. But in a country where luxury brands have expanded their retail presence aggressively - Vuitton is available even in provincial cities like Guangxi and Hefei - logo fatigue is starting to take hold sooner than expected. Indeed it's taken Chinese consumers only a few years to approach the level of maturation that took more than a decade to emerge in Japan.,It goes without saying that being seen as commonplace is poison for any luxury brand thus Arnault's plans to limit Vuitton's store openings and focus its communications on high-value logo-free leather goods that signal their specialness more discreetly through shape and materials.,But as Vuitton shifts course the challenge will be striking the right balance between exclusivity and popularity to remain profitable.,Disclosure: LVMH is part of a consortium of investors which has a minority stake in The Business of Fashion.,The post Has Logo Fatigue Reached a Tipping Point? appeared first on BoF - The Business of Fashion.,http://bit.ly/Z0Ogc9, , , , , ,the business of fashion,fashion,logo,luxury, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjmounPB901s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:10PnJ99, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It's an assaulting array of lo-fi neon textures quick edits and layered video collages designed for the shortest of attention spans. The clothes featured take a backseat to the brand's assertion that it's hip to digital culture and the aesthetics that have been circulating online under the umbrella of net art.,The video (above) accompanies Proenza's website relaunch and a whole slew of efforts intended to position the luxury brand as #new #hip #trendy #cuttingedge–from controversial YouTube films directed by Harmony Korine to GIFs by net artist Jeanette Hayes. The brand's designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez differentiate themselves from other luxury brands interested in tapping into old-fashioned stifled elegance. "This Internet aesthetic we're talking about there's no nostalgia to it. I think that scares people" McCollough told the Business of Fashion. "A lot of luxury brands like to fall back on nostalgia because nostalgia feels luxurious to them. We're into luxury but we're also equally interested in contemporary culture.", Nostalgia is an interesting choice of words. McCollough seems to be forgetting that contemporary culture and particularly the net art Tumblr aesthetic is loaded with nostalgia just nostalgia for a more recent era than the roaring twenties and drop-waist dresses. For example the aesthetics in Proenza's video harken back to early digital effects reminiscent of 80s movies like Tron and Dune. And GIFs turned 26 this year. One of Proenza's new GIFs featured above an anime cartoon of a young girl in her bedroom immediately brings to mind the 90s fad for Sailor Moon. This stuff isn't new. But what is new is our ability to access and circulate these images and moving images via platforms like Tumblr. The internet or at least how we use it accelerates the cycle of nostalgia.,An example of the nostalgic effects in the new Proenza Schouler fashion film.,In the same interview McCollough told the Business of Fashion that Proenza isn't "your mom's luxury brand." But I think moms might be the only people to whom this Tumblr-aesthetic is going to seem totally new. The trend has already made the transition from marginal to mainstream with its appearance in Azaelia Banks' music video and Rihanna's performance on SNL last December. And it's hit the fashion world too just see Kenzo's fashion film directed by Natalia Stuyk released two weeks ago. Considering the price tag of the goods Proenza's hocking–close to a thousand dollars for a dress–their target customer is probably not the 20-something on Tumblr but instead the uptown woman who wants a piece of it.,Digital culture and the aesthetics associated with it are only bound to get more and more popular-and as they do we can expect them to intersect with the fashion world more and more. But it's not just about fashion capitalizing on digital culture and the aesthetics associated with it. Digital culture and fashion culture are intersecting and breeding a culture all their own just check out witty fashion web magazine DIS Magazine or Greta Larkins GIF-based fashion Tumblr. Proenza Schouler is smart to get on board.,[via Business of Fashion],@CreatorsProject,http://bit.ly/X8BCsr, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashion,film,authenticity,luxury, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjmqb8rEgz1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:10DAwv9,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X8BBVi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:WoAV0F, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The chat primarily focused on Tumblr's history and the role it has played in allowing new media content creators to share and curate content for the web.,When asked about how Tumblr got started Karp said that he started it in 2005 as a simple tool he built for himself. Karp explained that he had tried other tools but became frustrated by their limitations.,The Tumblr founder went on to say that he realized most blogs were designed for writers. Karp explained that he tried other blogging formats that were available at the time (WordPress Blogger etc.) but never felt as if any were the right fit for him because the emphasis was always on writing and he wanted to focus on multimedia content.,With Tumblr he consolidated all the content into one place very easily which became a tool to help people easily express themselves and act as a representation of their online identity.,When asked about the site's phenomenal growth Karp reflected back and modestly admitted that he had no intention or idea it would rise to such popularity. He figured a few friends might enjoy the tool so he posted the first version and within a month Tumblr had hundreds of thousands of users,Karp attributes much of the site's success to that early community which "rose to the occasion and created blogs that didn't look like any other blogs.",This engagement convinced him that he should nurture it and continue to iterate on the platform. What he saw and sought to nurture was the use of Tumblr as a tool for curation which in itself can be a creative process. For Karp Tumblr facilitates two key behaviors: social behavior to share and human behavior to curate (what to wear posting of photos etc.).,Karp explains:,"Many of us are not the creators but they're [the creators] creative and compel us and pass on to us as colors and words we use to express ourselves.",The founder spoke about his belief that one of the things that makes Tumblr so unique is its vibrant community. For a long time in early versions comments were lacking but Karp felt like YouTube comments were horrible and that design influences how people interact and what they say.,For more SXSW check out our ongoing coverage here.,http://bit.ly/WoAV0S, , , , , , , , , , , , ,creativity,tech,tumblr,david karp, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjmqbasjO41s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:X8BBVr, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

More information + full content after the break.,,In Japanese art and textile printing the use of patterns has a long tradition. In Japanese architecture layering is an established technique that has already inspired the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Now the laboratory of renowned architect Kengo Kuma has developed a technically sophisticated methodology that unites patterns and layering in a single structural concept for the first time.,The book Patterns and Layering presents innovative structures that are created by stacking fragile patterned layers. Although each individual layer can contain a variety of patterns it will nevertheless still completely fulfill its structural responsibilities. The results are strikingly delicate yet remarkably stable.,The book's detailed texts explain how layering and patterns function as spatial tools with which one can create extraordinary structures that are able to coexist in harmony with nature people and culture. Patterns and Layering not only explores historical contexts and developments but also shows cutting-edge experiments that were realized with valuable input from Kengo Kuma and his colleague Yusuke Obuchi. According to Kuma the book "has the potential to begin a new architectural and design revolution.",Editors Salvator-John A. Liotta and Matteo Belfiore as well as other contributors worked closely with Kengo Kuma at his research laboratory at the University of Tokyo.

Perhaps. And only if you don't chase them away.,Recently Google co-founder Sergey Brin took to the stage at theTED "Ideas Worth Spreading" conference. His idea worth spreading? That cellphones are "emasculating.",This newsbyte currently making the rounds appears here and elsewhere out of context from a much longer pitch for Google Glass a high-tech monocle that is Google's eyebrow-raising vision for the next generation of wearable computing. But with reporters there to witness it live readers appear to have since deemed Brin's remark the most shareworthy headline of the event. (When asked about the remark's larger context Google didn't immediately elaborate on record.),With one word Brin appears to have shot in the direction of both feet: both possibly alienating Google's male Android smartphone customers and offputting women who might otherwise be in the market for Google Glass.,This is a point made clear by close technology follower and Wharton business ethics professorAndrea Matwyshyn who writes to TechCrunch:,That is a missed commercial opportunity. Women make a large portion of household consumer purchasing decisions in the United States and they tend to spend equal or greater numbers of hours using technology as do men according to some studies.,In other words a marketing strategy that positions Google Glass as a "man gadget" potentially alienates half of the consumer base who might have been keenly interested in purchasing the product in the future.,A question going forward is whether women beyond technology insiders like Matwyshyn have even heard about the gaffe let alone Google Glass altogether. In the meantime from an armchair perspective charts from Google Trends shows usage for the "emasculating" search term has skyrocketed and thousands of references to the quote appear to smear across Google News.,If the first rule of speaking is to know your audience such a remark prompts questions about whether Brin and by extension Google knows theirs. What will Google Glass be used for? The answer seems to be literally anyone's guess.,In a recently ended contest Google asked potential Google Glass customers - when "applying" to purchase the $1500 developer device - to identify and define themselves via the use of a #ifihadglass hashtag on Google+ or Twitter. Thanks to public messages and public APIs results from the #ifihadglass marketing campaign are in effect transparent.,In order to guess at what Google is seeing in terms of gender breakdown amid this abundance of marketing information TechCrunch collected close to 11000 Google+ posts and 22000 tweets tagged with #ifihadglass and looked at the likely gender of the authors' first names. The results suggest that if Google isn't yet worried about encouraging female adoption of Google Glass perhaps it should be.,Amateur analysis is fraught with guesswork - especially when dealing with gender-by-name since names such as "Taylor" can be donned by both females and males. To attempt to compensate a probability for each gender was assigned using census data on how frequently the name occurs by gender in the United States. Names like "Elizabeth" with greater than a 95 percent certainty of being a given gender was assigned to a gender group; mixed names like "Taylor" were compared across genders and become 'likely-male' or 'likely-female' and grouped together as 'uncertain'; both never-before-seen and non-names like "JetBlue" get lumped into the 'ambiguous' group.,To be taken with skepticism here's the breakdown of the TechCrunch analysis of the likely gender of authors of #ifihadglass postings on Google+:,For the 7358 Google+ postings whose authors had first names assigned to a gender group 86% were guessed to be posted by males and 14% by females.,Including 517 uncertain cases the numbers water down to 80% male and 13% female.,Among the uncertain cases 77% where thought to be 'likely male' and 23% 'likely female'.,27% of the overall 10782 found Google+ postings tagged with #ifihadglass were authored by people's whose names were deemed ambiguous.,For Twitter:,For the 10524 Twitter tweets whose authors had first names assigned to a gender group 80% were guessed to be male and 20% female.,Including 807 uncertain cases the numbers adjust to 74% male and 19% female.,Among the uncertain cases 72% where thought to be 'likely male' and 28% 'likely female'.,48% of the overall 21684 tweets found at the time were deemed as authored by someone whose first name was too ambiguous to gender.,Google has a real name policy that makes its publicly findable data quality a little better than Twitter's. The gender breakdown of Google+ users is uncertain and so a good baseline of over-/under-representation by gender cannot be established across both Twitter and Google+.,Any uncontrolled or publicly sourced data are suspect and the underlying dataset here is not an exception. Another possible problem is that kind of hashtag analysis also embraces the "no press is bad press" mentality and includes those freeriding with their own marketing efforts and and those just having some fun.,tech,women,gender,google,google glass,wearables, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjplt8RSc41s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:guessedgendergoogle.jpg?w=640&h=345,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:guessedgendertwitter.jpg?w=640&h=345, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It's the go-to framework for endless heroic adventures where fabulous male heroes journey to save [insert female captured by villain here]. One of the earliest of these is the classic tale of a plucky mustachioed plumber on a vertical girder-climbing quest to save his lady Pauline from the barrel-throwing primate Donkey Kong. It was the game that would set the stage for a long series of Mario adventures where his princess would continue to be captured and wind up "in another castle.",After being introduced to the game Mike Mika's 3-year-old daughter Ellis asked why she couldn't "play as the girl" and rescue Mario instead. (She'd recently played Super Mario Bros. 2 where you could play as Princess Toadstool). She was disappointed to find that she couldn't.,So Mika a game designer by trade and chief creative officer at Other Ocean Interactive set out to flip the script on the game and make it happen. He spent a furious night of hacking through the game's code and swapping out all of the Mario graphical sprites and color palettes for new ones of Pauline.,He posted his progress on Facebook and YouTube to share with friends. Soon the projectfound its way to social-sharing site Reddit where it went viral and earned Mika several superlatives across the Internet including "feminist hero dad" and "dad of the year.",The end result he writes in Wired was met with a lot of excitement from his daughter.,,"She was excited! But for all she knew I just figured out how to get Pauline to work. And that was fine. I wasn't expecting it to change her life. We played for a bit. And some more. And again later. You know what? She really did seem to enjoy the game more. For whatever reason she was more motivated to play as Pauline than as Mario. I can't read into that too much because it does feel a bit like a new game to her still. So we'll see how she does after a week with it.",,This isn't the first time someone has done something like this though the first time with such a classic game. Last year Mike Hoye re-scripted a Zelda game to make the hero a girl for his daughter as well.,Mika however says he didn't set out to push any sort of feminist agenda or statement. He writes that he simply wanted to "keep that little grin lit up on my daughter's face every time we sit down to play games together.",This also isn't the first time Mika has used his programming skills for the ladies in his life. According to comments from friends on Reddit Mika also apparently proposed to his wife by hiding a secret code in a game he was working on at the time.,(via Dad's 'Donkey Kong' Hack Recasts Female As Hero For Daughter : All Tech Considered : NPR), , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,gender,donkey kong,video games,heros,heroines, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjpmm37JjL1s75lgto1_250.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Sarkeesian sought $6000 on Kickstarter to produce slicker versions of her earlier DIY series and she was smeared by vile angry gamer-dudes who created games where you could beat the crap out of her for the sin of identifying as a feminist and daring to question the portrayal of gender in games. The happy ending to this shameful episode is that her Kickstarter became a good-people vs goons plebiscite and would up raising $158922. The first installment is "Damsels in Distress" and is a smart well-researched wonderfully presented history of the woman-waiting-for-a-hero trope through gaming history. It's just in time for International Women's Day and is a wonderful kickoff for a new series.

The self-trackers who near-obsessively capture and analyze their own data are part of a growing "Quantified Self" movement. Interested in giving self-tracking a try? Self-tracker Peter Zandan an executive at Hill Knowlton Strategies who headed up a panel on Quantified Self this year at South by Southwest helped us curate this list of apps and devices to get more data feedback from your daily life. If you're just getting started the most "mainstream" self-tracking devices are the Fitbit Jawbone UP and Nike Fuelband. Apple's getting in on this wristband-tracking market with its iWatch which is expected to come out at the end of this year. For heart rate monitoring devices Garmin and Polar both make options that self-trackers like. Food monitoring apps include MyFitnessPal and MyPlate. "[These are] great for folks who want to do more than count calories" Zandan said. If you want to dig a little deeper these self-tracking devices apps and systems might teach you something that you don't know about yourself. 23andMe: A DNA analysis service that provides information and tools for you to learn about your genetic traits disease risk and ancestry; you mail a saliva sample for laboratory testing. Talking20: Amino acid testing to monitor what is happening in your body over time; you mail small blood samples and receive digital results. Moodscope: An app that allows you to track your mood each day using an online card game; look at scores over time and share with friends. Zeo: A comprehensive sleep monitoring system that includes a lightweight headband bedside display online analytical tools and email-based personalized coaching program. Equanimity: An app that provides reminders and feedback for your meditation practice; it includes a timer journal for note-taking and historical graphics.

Do you use a computer mobile phone electronic gadget or pen and paper to record your work sleep exercise diet mood or anything else? Would you like to share your methods and learn from what others are doing? If so you are in the right place. This short intro will help you get you oriented. What is Quantified Self? Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects the tools we use tips we've gleaned lessons we've learned. We blog meet face to face and collaborate online. There are three main "branches" to our work. *The Quantified Self blog and community site. You are here! This is the central hub where we keep track of all important goings-on and you will soon be able to make connections develop ongoing collaborations and share detailed documentation of your personal projects. *Quantified Self Show&Tell meetings. These are face-to-face meetings very fun and interesting where you can see QS projects first hand and meet QS people in your local area. The meetings started in the San Francisco Bay Area but local chapters are springing up all over the world. If there is not yet a meeting in your area and you wish there were you can learn how to start one by reading: How to Start Your Own QS Show&Tell. *Quantified Self Conference. This is a conference for users and tool makers interested in self-tracking systems. It is a "working meeting" for the QS community (40 groups worldwide) where we gather inspire and learn from each other as we share and collaborate on self-tracking projects. We also explore the potential effects of self-tracking on ourselves and society. If you are an advanced user designer tech inventor entrepreneur journalist scientist or health professional please join us for a weekend of collaboration and inspiration! Who is responsible for Quantified Self? The QS blog and community are maintained and moderated by Alexandra Carmichael Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf. Regular contributors include Rajiv Mehta (Toolmaker Talks) Ernesto Ramirez (Numbers from around the Web) and other QS friends around the world. Each of the QS Show&Tell meetings has its own set of organizers. When you sign up at the link you will be able to contact the local organizer. We also maintain a complete list of local QS Show&Tell organizers with links to meetups and some additional information. Administration of the web site production of the QS conference and other community support functions are the work of Quantified Self Labs. What other resources are there? The Quantified Self Forum is a place for the community to discuss any topics they want. The Complete QS Guide to Self-Tracking is a collection of tools apps and projects. Our goal is to gather and organize the world's collective self-tracking resources in one place. Dive in now and explore some of the Tools or Members who are part of this site. Videos from the meetups are available at the Quantified Self Vimeo Group. Selected press mentions are here. Follow us on Twitter @quantifiedself. How can I help?

Are those supplements working for you? Has your diet change impacted your cholesterol for the better? Exactly how high is your stress? Talking20 will test your blood and post results on a private profile just for you. The more you test and track the more you can understand your body. Knowledge is power.,Who can order this?,Anyone. Talking20 is designed as a tool for wellness for everyone in our communities. That is why we made it easy to use cost effective and accessible to anyone.,Which tests are currently available?,We are currently developing our first wave of blood tests. Results for the following tests will be available in Spring 2013: ,Cholesterol (Total HDL and LDL) Estradiol (Estrogen) Progesterone Testosterone Homocysteine CRP HgA1c Cortisol and Vitamins A B6 B9 B12 C D3 and E.,Are more tests coming?,Yes! We are already thinking about the next wave of tests that we want to calibrate. Feel free to let us know what you want to see next. Test Designer opportunities are available please contact info@talking20.com for details. ,How much do the return envelopes cost?,Return envelope containing a card is a standard size letter and will require one stamp. As we are sending packages around the world we are currently leaving adding the stamp in your hands.  Feel free to collect your cards up and put a few into one envelope before sending them to save more.,How do I collect the spots? How does the lancet work?,Your kit includes complete instructions.  Blood spot testing is pretty quick you just press the 1mm lancet firmly against your finger and you feel a quick 'bee sting' exactly what diabetics experience several times a day when checking their blood sugar.   Even after doing 10-20 of these tests at once we can say its hard to tell you did it at all the next day.  As warm fingers are best for spots we recommend you warm your fingers under hot water before doing the test but feel free to figure out what works best for you. We suggest you collect spots from the outside tip of the fingers as there's great circulation there and you'll hardly notice you did it.,How many blood spots do I need to provide?  ,Our T20 Spot Kit comes with detailed instructions and a card with room for 5 blood spots to be collected.  One spot can be enough to get your reading but its more accurate if we have multiple samples and can calculate an average from those.  When applying your blood drop to the card try to get as big a drop as possible and fill the circle on the card.  It can take practice to figure out where on your finger you might have a good capillary bed to do this or you might have to warm up your fingers if they are cold!,When will I get my results?,We will be testing and posting results in the order we receive the cards. Those who purchased tests first will receive results first. We intend to being posting result profiles in the Spring 2013.

It's carefully designed to be the ideal companion for anyone who meditates.The journal is comparable in quality to many standalone note-taking apps. It allows you to optionally take notes after your sittings and lets you browse through your meditation history as either a visually annotated log or textual journal. All of your recorded data can be exported as a nicely formatted email that you can print or as a table that you can load into a spreadsheet. You can also email individual journal entries - useful for posting them on a blog.Easy to read graphics let you know at a glance how regularly you are meditating and how long your daily practice has been going. A chart illustrates your progress over the course of the year and a bar graph shows the total number of hours you have meditated. As a reminder if you forget to sit the application icon optionally counts the number of days since you last meditated. It's much easier to keep going with a routine when you can see so clearly how you are doing.The timer shows time passing using clean graphics that allow you to see at a glance where you are within your sitting period without being unduly distracted.If your meditation routine incorporates different stages within a single sitting you can set chimes to ring at the appropriate points using straightforward controls.You can turn off the ringer and the gongs will still sound so you don't need to worry about being interrupted by phone calls or SMS. If you do need to attend to a message briefly you can carry on from where you left off. For people whose meditation practice involves chants or prayer you can also now switch to other apps and the timer will still run and the chimes will still ring.Because the timer is intended to be used every day the design provides a calm and clear experience without unnecessary clutter.This application has helped me to make meditation a daily practice and I hope it can do the same for you.Customer Service: if you are considering leaving a poor review please contact me to see if I can help you first. I reply to every single customer email.Features:- Icon Badge reminders - counts the days since you last sat. (IOS 4) (NEW)- Works in background on devices that support multitasking.

In the future devices for personal entertainment and military use will increase dramatically. For example the introduction ofGoogle's Smart Glasses and the rumored Apple Smart Watch" will be part of a new wave of wireless wearable devices. Sleep sensors hand-worn terminals and industrial and military head's up displays - transparent screens that provide data and are attached to helmets - will provide users with actionable data leading to even more rapid expansion in the market for wearable technology.,Most wearable wireless devices today are used to transmit vital signs or to track user exercise performance or fitness metrics. Dominating the market are continuous glucose monitors such as devices from Abbott and Medtronic and activity monitors such as those from Fitbit Adidas miCoach and Nike Fuelband. Fitness and heart-rate monitors from Garmin Polar and Suunto are also market leaders Ahadome said.,The Federal Communications Commission recently approved a Medical Body Area Network (MBAN) radio spectrum for use in hospitals. The MBAN spectrum first is expected to be used in hospitals but over time medical instrument vendors say MBAN devices could be used at home where 80% of health care services are delivered.,Unlike traditional medical telemetry systems which require separate links for each function being monitored wireless MBAN systems could monitor all required functions and then aggregate the results and transmit them to a remote location for evaluation. The data could be uploaded to private clouds within hospital data centers and also to public cloud providers such as Microsoft's HealthVault.,While medical wireless devices and their data will be regulated under HIPAA (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) one problem with consumer-grade wearable devices is that the information will likely be sent over unsecured networks to public cloud service providers.,For example consumers may upload workout and sleep monitoring data into online personal health records.,"You don't necessarily want many applications in different places but in one centralized place" Ahadome said. "Personal fitness records will be cloud based. It becomes a free-for-all in terms of where your data goes.",Last year the amount of information created and replicated surpassed 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 trillion gigabytes) growing by a factor of nine in just five years according to IDC's Digital Universe study.,While 75% of the information in the digital universe is generated by individuals less than one-third of all stored data today has even minimalsecurity or protection. Only about half the information that should be protected is protected at all IDC stated., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,wearables,statistics,market research,prediction, , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Wearable_Technologies.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In the early 1980s around the time Apple issued its IPO and Time magazine named the PC its Machine of the Year women accounted for just over 37% of the students earning bachelor's degrees in computer science. By 2010 that percentage had fallen to a little more than 17% according to latest available data from the National Science Foundation.,Sandberg who is COO at Facebook argues that women have to be more assertive to "lean in" as she writes in her book Lean In: Women Work and the Will to Lead.,But women are under-represented in IT something that's been obvious for years at male-dominated tech conferences. U.S. labor data backs this up.,,Last year women held only 26% of the jobs in computer-related occupations. That represented a one-percentage-point increase from 2011 but that slight uptick wasn't enough to counter an overall decline in the number of female IT professionals since 2000 when women's share of the computer-related jobs pool hit its peak at nearly 30% according labor data analyzed by the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT).,Tammi Pirri vice president of human resources at Black Duck Software an open-source software services and development firm sees what's going on first hand. She said that in her eight years at Black Duck "we've only had one female engineering intern but we've had 10 male engineering interns.",The decline in women studying computer science in college aside Pirri believes that Sandberg is right: "Women must find a way to ask for what they want without being perceived in a negative way" she said. "That's the challenge and where women need to lean in and not just assert what they want but show it's deserved.",Jenny Slade the communications director at NCWIT noted that many people have criticized Sandberg for her focus on "changing the women rather than changing the system.","But frankly if she'd written a polemic on institutional bias in the workplace she'd have been criticized for painting women as victims" said Slade who argues that "changing the status quo starts with a conversation that leads people to take action.",That discussion might include people such as Kim Stevenson the vice president and CIO of Intel one of 24 female CIOs in Fortune 100 companies.,Stevenson said Intel has done things to help women advance their careers. Among other things the company offers mentoring programs and opportunities for network-building - an activity that Sandberg champions. The chip maker's Women at Intel Network has 22 chapters.,"No one likes to feel that they are a unit of one" said Stevenson. She doesn't share Sandberg's view that progress for women has stalled but she said that she believes more can be done.,Intel's efforts have paid off said Stevenson. The rate of attrition among women is low and the company says the number of female employees in mid- to senior-level technical jobs has increased 24% since 2004.,Kathy Harris managing director of Harris Allied an executive recruiting firm specializing in technology is among those who believe women need to create a professional support network. "In pure technology departments men still outnumber women by as much as nine to one" said Harris. "The sole woman in a predominantly male team often feels a sense of isolation.",There are many theories about why women and especially girls aren't considering IT-related training. Culture plays a role some argue.,Karie Willyerd vice president of learning and social adoption at SAP wonders if unflattering depictions of engineers in popular culture - like those in the comic strip Dilbert - have discouraged girls from thinking about careers in IT.,But the cultural message may be shifting said Willyerd who points to things like building block maker Lego's efforts to attract girls and expose them to engineering.,"[Software engineering] is not only well paid but highly flexible and conducive to a woman that wants to work throughout their children's formative years" said Paula Hunter executive director of the Outercurve Foundation a nonprofit that offers a forum where open-source and commercial software developers can come together. A high percentage of startups are also founded by engineers she notes.,Stephanie Reel senior vice president for management systems and information services at John Hopkins Health System said that in the healthcare field she has worked for and with men and women "who have been fair balanced and professional - in a business world that is often dominated by women." Women have a significant presence in healthcare overall in part because a high percentage of the people who go into nursing are women she said.,But Reel does agree that the most senior positions in leading U.S. organizations including those in healthcare are still mostly held by men. It may be more evolution than revolution at work she argues.,"Perhaps men are choosing to be more focused on linear career paths" said Reel "while women are sometimes choosing to be more curious and more patient seeking rewards and recognition in different ways - perhaps seeking to influence the future of an organization more broadly than a man might.",http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9237532/Facebook_s_Sandberg_stirs_debate_among_women_in_IT, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,women,lean in,sandberg, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_inline_mjtgs44Zez1qz4rgp.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Politicians coffee shops food art are scrutinized for evidence of inauthenticity. But some things are too real to be true… ,,,Picture the tragic scenes in Crouch End north London early this year. The patrons of Harris + Hoole a local coffee shop had just learned to their horror that the supermarket chain Tesco owns a 49 per cent stake in the company. Shaken caffeine-guzzlers told the Guardian that they felt "duped" and "upset" because they'd thought it was an "independent" coffee shop. A rival coffee hawker sneered that Tesco was "trying to make money" out of "artisan values" – although presumably so was he.  Most charmingly the manager of the café confided that head office had instructed her to make the store feel as independent as possible. "We try to be independent" she said. "We want to be independent. We want to have that feel.",She is right: we all want to have that feel. But the appropriation by Tesco and Harris + Hoole of the consumer allure of "independence" and "artisan values" is a symptom of our present predicament: there is no way out of simulation. What we get in an "authentic" cultural product is still a simulacrum but one that insists even more loudly that its laminated wood-effect veneer is the real thing. Authenticity is now yet another brand value to be baked into the commodity and customers are happy to take this spectral performance of a presumed virtue as the truth.,But what was so authentic about the authenticity being simulated? Today's heroically "independent" baristas are profiting from a market that in the UK wouldn't exist without the trail blazed in the 1990s by the now-despised big chains such as Starbucks. Thanks to them you can now open an independent coffee shop and charge considerably more than a chain while decrying the rapacity of the giants that prepared the ground for you. Be careful though not to do too well and expand too far because then you will lose all independence becoming a despicable corporation in turn. The middle-class admiration for authenticity is predicated on the patronising condition that the little man shouldn't get too big for his boots.,One way out of this hall of mirrors is to insist ever more loudly that one's own offering is really truly authentic. Innumerable industrial products now advertise themselves as "real" following the lead of Coke's slogan "the Real Thing". In 2011 even Starbucks began selling salad-based lunchboxes labelled "Real Food". A box of Rombouts's disposable one-cup coffee filters describes its flavour as "Original Blend … Medium 3 AUTHENTIC". Even Marks & Spencer's men's underwear is branded "authentic" posing the nice question of what an inauthentic pair of boxer shorts or trunks would look like. Yet authenticity can be signalled in more subtle ways. Second-hand clothes have been redescribed as "vintage" as though they were fine wines which flatteringly projects an air of discriminating scholarship on to the prospective buyer. Some new clothes call themselves pre-worn faded or distressed soaking the product in an ersatz history and off-the-peg personality. More recently such pre-ageing has become available even for far more expensive products such as electric guitars. Fender's "Road Worn" range of Stratocasters and Telecasters features "authentic" dents and scratches and areas where the paint or varnish has been painstakingly sandpapered off; the white plastic trimmings have been yellowed as though through years of exposure to nicotine in smoky clubs.,What we value in culture can reveal much about our attitudes to hierarchy and power. Photograph: Getty Images,Modern mass-media gluttony or foodism has its own cluster of presumed "authentic" virtues. The idea of "real" food is sometimes parsed adorably as food with no chemicals though all food is made of chemicals. It is widely assumed that food sold as organic is purer and closer to an assumedly benign Nature although no food is made from inorganic matter and organic farming standards sanction the use of neurotoxic fertilisers. What the unwashed non-foodist masses eat on the other hand is routinely derided as "junk" or "processed" food the poor souls doomed for ever to inauthentic scoffing. Yet the invention of processed foods such as Hovis bread in the 19th century was itself an authenticity drive a way of addressing the widespread adulteration of so many foods.,Meanwhile foodists vie to identify the authentic versions of exotic dishes. In the American TV cook Julia Child's memoir of her life in France she derides a proud Frenchwoman who insists that no true Marseillaise would add tomatoes to her bouillabaisse. Child you see has looked the recipe up in a French cookbook and there it includes tomatoes. She therefore concludes with hysterical snobbery that the Frenchwoman is an ignoramus instead of accepting that such traditional recipes come in many variations and that the idea that there is one version is a crude mistake. Here Child exhibits too the craving for authenticity of the internationally roaming glutton or gastrotourist specimens of which genre to this day compose purple paeans for the glossy magazines about the latest far-flung country in which the locals miraculously manage to cobble together authentic plates of the national victuals in their charmingly primitive kitchens.,Authenticity in art is a question that goes back at least to Plato's complaint that theatre and poetry could not convey truth. One meaning of the authenticity of a painting or text is merely that the creator has been correctly identified. But as far back as the early English novel literature was already toying with manufactured authenticity as an advertising gimmick: Defoe'sMoll Flanders (1721) claims on its title page to be "Written from her own Memorandums"; while Robinson Crusoe (1719) is not credited to its real author at all but was supposedly "Written by Himself" (that is Crusoe).,Later an explicit authenticity craze occur - red in the Weimar Republic between 1924 and 1929. In reaction to the perceived excesses of expressionism a movement called the New Objectivity sprang up. Novels were marketed as "authentic" because they were supposedly based on real-world research; the story circulated that the Austrian writer Vicki Baum had worked as a maid in a large Berlin hotel in order to collect material forMenschen im Hotel later filmed as Grand Hotel.,This idea that fiction derives its authenticity from reportage has persisted – up to and including novelists such as Tom Wolfe and the brain-surgeon-shadowing Ian McEwan – but heaven help you if you try to sell factbased fiction as fact. When it turned out that James Frey's "memoir" A Million Little Pieces was fictionalised the author was pilloried for having exploited so deftly the way we venerate real emotion and experience. It seems we can no longer tolerate the playful ambiguity of the 18th century. As George W Bush memorably put it in a different context: "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me … er … you can't get fooled again.",If you type the words "authenticity" and "authentic" into Google's Ngram Viewer which plots graphs of the use of words in books over a given period you will find that there has been a strong uptick in usage since the early 1990s. It might be no coincidence that this parallels the rise to ubiquity of digital creative technologies. Perhaps people become more worried about art's authenticity once they understand that modern technology makes everything liquid and endlessly revisable. Much has been made of how in Tom Hooper's film of Les Misérables the actors are "really" singing on set though few have asked why these people can't just talk to one another instead of dragging out what should be a 20-second dramatic interlude into an interminable ensemble singalong.,In an interview Hooper boasted that his film was swimming against the tide of our "postmodern age" because it was "made without irony". This too is an appeal to a kind of authenticity a sincerity of purpose – though it depends on a lamentably etiolated idea of irony as mere glibness.,Kathryn Bigelow's film Zero Dark Thirty meanwhile describes itself on a title card as being "based on first-hand accounts of actual events" and thus lays claim to the authenticity of reportage. (James Boswell claimed a similar documentary fidelity for his Life of Johnson: "What I have preserved … has the value of the most perfect authenticity.") However Zero Dark Thirty's screenwriter Mark Boal was quick to defend the film against the (silly) charge that it is pro-torture by quickly disclaiming that same documentary authority. Oh come on he told the Times exasperatedly "It's a movie! It's a movie! It's a movie!",More disturbingly the unexamined hunger for authentic culture can rapidly turn into a witch-hunt. After Beyoncé sang "The Star- Spangled Banner" at Barack Obama's inauguration the story got started that she had been lip-syncing. But in several videos available you can clearly hear two Beyoncés: there is a pre-recorded vocal plus a Beyoncé who is perfectly obviously singing live. One would like here to diagnose a mob-like rage for authenticity which fastened on a sacrificial victim with no regard for the justice of its accusations. Tellingly that Beyoncé removed an earpiece monitor during her performance was taken by the authenticity police as evidence in its own right of the inauthenticity of her act; commentators supposed that taking out the earpiece was too suspiciously ostentatious a demonstration that she had one at all. (Though she probably did it the better to hear her own voice as singers often do.) This narrative proved impervious to Beyoncé's subsequent explanation. Because she hadn't had a proper soundcheck or rehearsal she said she decided to leave the pre-recorded vocal in the mix as a kind of safety net while she sang live as well. "I decided to sing along with my pre-recorded performance" is what Beyoncé said – which was immediately taken as a "confession" to the very crime she thereby denied. The story was wrongly headlined on BBC News and elsewhere as "Beyoncé admits to inauguration lip-syncing".,So too persuasive a performance of authenticity will be taken as a sign of inauthenticity. The authenticity-obsessed want something to be real but they're on a hair trigger to cry foul if it seems too real to be true. The counterproductive upshot is that gifted artists are unfairly accused of relying on technological fixes. (It's common these days to complain about excessive use of Auto-Tune to correct singers' pitch but some singers have naturally terrific intonation.) So the authentophiles can no longer reliably perceive what they claim to value; indeed they risk destroying it. (Why bother doing something for real if no one will believe you did?) The cult of authenticity in other words begins from an assumption that most things are fake and in doing so ensures that they will be.,It also reifies a simplistic notion of what is fake to begin with. A blanket privileging of the concrete and the in-person an indie disdain for post-production or Photoshopping implicitly downgrades artworks that from their inception are computer-mediated and could not exist otherwise even though there is nothing inauthentic about an uplifting Eurotrance track or a Hockney iPad painting. The fetish for authenticity here as in the realms of food and vintage clothing shows itself to be inherently anti-modern always looking back to an imagined prelapsarian idyll.,Authenticity is a useful pose in the poli - tical arena too. Claiming to be "realist" in international relations (as Obama's new foreign policy team has been described) handily implies that your opponents purvey nothing but utopian pipe dreams. The notion of authenticity is all the more prized the more that politics appears to be nothing but spin and posture. On the New York Review of Books blog Elizabeth Drew paid the highest pos sible modern compliment to Joe Biden when she described him as "one of the most authentic politicians in Washington – he really is who he appears to be: warm and decent and never forgetting his workingclass roots … his core is consistent". But the implication that more politicians should be who they appear to be is a weird and onerous demand that the distinction between public and private identities be collapsed for the public's benefit – in other words that politics become more like I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!. To reserve "authentic" as the ultimate praise for a politician is right in tune with the Facebook mogul Mark Zuck - erberg's pathological opinion that "having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity".,To define a person's authenticity as the perfect conjunction of outward seeming and inward being is not a new idea. (Hamlet is nearly as outraged by the inauthenticity of Claudius's acting – "That one may smile and smile and be a villain!" – as he is by Claudius having murdered his father.) But what matters most now is that such personal authenticity be performed plausibly: on reality TV paradoxically contestants routinely accuse their rivals of being "fake" or "insincere" and attempt to present as "genuine" or "real" a front as possible.,In some quarters marketing claims to authenticity are almost perfectly devoid of semantic content. Consider the words of Bret Robins creative director of the exhilaratingly cartoonish megadeath-simulator video gameModern Warfare 3. In an interview he described how his team designed this World War III face-shooting fantasy in which your one-man army more or less single-handedly defeats the invading Russians: "You try to do it in a very believable and authentic way so it feels like this could actually happen." The only things that could be described as authentic in such video games however are the lovingly modelled guns. Nothing else about Modern Warfare 3 is authentic in any way though it is believable enough when you're there playing the game as is navigating any well-crafted made-up world.,This is as it should be. When we're at play we don't want things to be too oppressively real. (As T S Eliot nearly wrote humankind cannot bear too much authenticity.) But what about when we are at work? The problem of authenticity in labour was one that exercised Jean-Paul Sartre in his best-known example of its opposite. Sartre developed the existentialist sense of "authenticity" that is opposed to "bad faith" and illustrated the second idea with a vignette of a waiter in a café. In Sartre's eyes the waiter resembles a parodic automaton: he walks up to the customers too quickly; he bows too eagerly; he is oversolicitous; he carries his tray as though performing a highwire circus act.,The waiter's performance like Beyoncé's is too real to be true. He is lip-syncing his job playing at being a waiter impersonating an idea. And this Sartre concludes is bad faith because the waiter ought to know that he cannot ever really be a waiter any more than he can be anything else. In playacting his job he is trying to evade his own nothingness his own absolute freedom.

These issues brought a panel moderated by author Mark Borden and comprised of GE Head of Digital Marketing Katrina Craigwell Digitas VP of Brand Content Eric Korsh Getty Images VP of Business Development Peter Orlowsky and DeviantArt VP of Global Advertising Sales Daniel Bornstein together at SXSW for an in-depth panel discussion titled "Visual Conversation: Being at The Center of Social.",Unilaterally everyone agreed that in today's world a catchy tagline isn't enough:"With image-driven networks like Tumblr and Instagram taking center stage collaborative storytelling is more important than ever. In order to leverage your brand product or campaign across all channels you need strong visual content." The panel focused on two overarching themes: how to create quality work for brands and the challenges of monetization of visuals in digital and social media.,To kick things off moderator Borden asked the group how they identify what is worth creating on behalf of brands to which Eric Korsh of Digitas replied: "You have to ask yourself 'Is that something that I would share as a consumer?' In that process make sure that you challenge yourself and your clients that if this is something we are doing or are we just checking the box in that 'content area' for today. Furthermore "You need to approach social content different from traditional ads. And you can equate this social content to fruit flies in that their lifespan is so short. You need to use it move fast learn quickly move on and apply those learnings to the next project.",Katrina of GE chimed in on the importance of keeping the consumer in mind pointing out that they recognize that in social media you're competing with all content not just your direct competition. As a result they focus on creating great content with the goal of social distribution.,In discussing the challenges of monetization DeviantArt and Getty Images had some very innovative things happening on their respective platforms. Getty Images has rolled out a variety of tools which empower people by giving them credit for their work and make sure every content creator can monetize. To accomplish this Orlowksy shared insight into the unique Getty technology stating: "We've got a great solution which allows us to see which images have been shared across platforms. Using fingerprinting service to track how images are shared and where they go allows for the ability to license images on the fly.",On the DeviantArt side Bornstein shared how the site has become a discovery engine for artists empowering them to elevate their profile and giving them great exposure and opportunities they may not otherwise have. For example a piece on the site ("Sweet Halloween Dreams" by Begemott) recently generated a ton of online buzz and The Rock saw it and approached New Line to create a movie around the image which is now in the works.,Overall it's clear that today's landscape has challenged marketers creators and media properties to come up with new and innovative ways to distribute and monetize the content.,http://bit.ly/XA2lUF, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,content,tech,brendan gahan,conference,sxsw, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjnxo8Wzrn1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:XA2lUA,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:XA2nvL, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The images above are from my ever-expanding collection of quotes about how design and technology will 'disappear' become 'invisible' or how the 'best interface is no interface'.,The Verge has recently given both Oliver Reichenstein andGolden Krishna a platform to talk about this. This has spawned manifestos films talks books #NoUI hashtagsand some debates about what it might mean. I'll call this cluster of things 'invisible design'.,I agree with some of the reasons driving this movement; that design's current infatuation with touchscreens is really problematic. I've spent the last eight years rallying againstglowing rectangles studying our obsession with screensand the ways in which this has become a cultural phenomena. In response I have been researching andinventing interfaces for taking interaction out from under the glass.,But I also take issue with much of the thinking for a few reasons that I'll outline below.,1. Invisible design propagates the myth of immateriality,We already have plenty of thinking that celebrates the invisibility and seamlessness of technology. We are overloaded with childish mythologies like 'the cloud'; a soft fuzzy metaphor for enormous infrastructural projects of undersea cables and power-hungry data farms. This mythology can be harmful and is often just plain wrong. Networks go down hard disks fail sensors fail to sense processors overheat and batteries die.,Computing systems are suffused through and through with the constraints of their materiality. –Jean-François Blanchette,Invisible design propogates the myth that technology will 'disappear' or 'just get out of the way' rather than addressing the qualities of interface technologies that can make them difficult or delightful.,Intentionally hiding the phenomena and materiality of interfaces smoothing over the natural edges seams and transitions that constitute all technical systems entails a loss of understanding and agency for both designers and users of computing. Lack of understanding leads to uncertainty and folk-theories that hinder our ability to use technical systems and clouds the critique of technological developments.,As systems increasingly record our personal activity and data invisibility is exactly the wrong model.,By removing our knowledge of the glue that holds the systems that make up the infrastructure together it becomes much more difficult if not impossible to begin to understand how we are constructed as subjects what types of systems are brought into place (legal technical social etc.) and where the possibilities for transformation exist. –Matt Ratto (2007),In other words as both users and designers of interface technology we are disenfranchised by the concepts of invisibility and disappearance.,2. Invisible design falls into the natural/intuitive trap,The movement tells us to 'embrace natural processes' and talks about the 'incredibly intuitive' Mercedes car interface. This language is a trap (we should ban the use of naturaland intuitive btw) that doesn't give us any insight into how complex products might actually become simple or familiar.,Invisible design leads us towards the horrors of Reality Clippy. Does my refrigerator light really go off? Why was my car unlocked this morning? How did my phone go silent all of a sudden? Without highly legible systems for managing and understanding all of this 'smartness' we are going to get very lost and highly frustrated. The tricky business of push notifications and the Facebook privacy train wreck is just the tip of the iceberg.,The example of the Nest thermostat invisibly 'learning' your habits to control your home temperature is a good one. But the Nest has a highly visible interface that reassures you as to its status tells you when it is learning and a large dial for adjusting temperature. Beautiful legiblemicrointeractions. A Nest without these visual and direct manipulation interfaces would be useless uncanny and frustrating. Nest wants UI.,The discussion around invisible design often talks about using sensors and tangible interfaces instead of visual interfaces. But these systems are not inherently simpler or more familiar. They have their own material qualities with edges and 'grain' that need to be understood and learnt. Their literal invisibility can cause confusion even fear and they often increase unpredictability and failure.,,,In our work with interface technologies such as RFID andcomputer vision we've discovered that it takes a lot of workto make sense of the technologies as design materials. So it's not useful to say that UI is 'disappearing' into sensing algorithms and tangible interfaces when we don't fully understand them as UI yet.,3. Invisible design ignores interface culture,Interfaces are the dominant cultural form of our time. So much of contemporary culture takes place through interfaces and inside UI. Interfaces are part of cultural expression and participation skeuomorphism is evidence that interfaces are more than chrome around content and more than tools to solve problems. To declare interfaces 'invisible' is to deny them a cultural form or medium. Could we say 'the best TV is no TV' the 'best typography is no typography' or 'the best buildings are no architecture'?,Much of our work at BERG is not just about solving problems but about cultural invention:,We're not interested in this idea of the invisible technology in a modernist sense. Tech won't be visible but only if it's embedded into the culture that it exists within. By foregrounding the culture you background the technology. It's the difference between grinding your way through menus on an old Nokia trying to do something very simple and inhabiting the bright bouncy bubbly universe of iOS. The technology is there of course but it's effectively invisible as the culture is foregrounded." – Jack Schulze (in Domus 965 / January 2013),tech,noui,intuitive ui,natural ui,invisible design,design, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrfgmVi431s75lgto1_1280.gif, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dieter_rams-10principles-04.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Legible-interaction1.gif, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And it's not in "filters" in the current sense of the word.,I've noticed an interesting difference in the way people use the word "editing" when they talk about photography. Most people use "editing" to refer to the process of modifying a single image to make it look different which might include cropping saturation contrast and increasingly using a preset filter to condense a complicated set of editing procedures. And if you look at a large set of pictures from a photographer each image will often be edited quite differently to whatever look worked best for that photo.,But when I talk to professional photographers they use "editing" to refer to the process of selecting a certain set of images to present in a series to show a body of work which is often used to tell a story or deliver an overarching message. Usually they use a consistent composition vantage point and framing and vary the subject in order to focus people on the message of the series.,And therein lies the future of filters.,Semil Shah:,The tricky thing here is that only in hindsight do filters or boards or exploding pictures make sense.,But why do they make sense? It's not the filters or the boards or the exploding pictures themselves: it's what they accomplish as easy-to-use tools to make our photos better. Consider Vine:,Vine also skips the filters. That would just add an extra step to making a video clip that doesn't add much instant value to it. Instead Vine lets you string multiple shots together in a way that's just as simple as Instagram's filters. Editing it seems is the "filters of video"–the value-add that video can do quickly and easily that other visual media can't.,Exactly. Filters win because they are easy simple ways to make our photos better. Vine's editing wins over other video apps because it makes the process of creating a video incredibly easy. We have an abundance of complex rich powerful tools to edit photos and many of us app swap between a number of apps to reach the effects we want but when push comes to shove we use whatever is the easiest way to create and share what we want people to see.,Video has struggled to get the same adoption at scale for a pretty simple issue: the variability of quality after the click. Scan a photo you get the whole picture. Scan a thumbnail of a slice of a video and you get a guess of what's behind the click. Any indecision or lack of commitment to see beyond the slice and we don't click.,Vine wins because it standardizes the format the aspect ratio and even the length of the video. Less variation in the editing reduces the variation behind the click lowers the decision process about clicking play and standardizes how the content is presented. The focus is on the subject and the message.,The standardization effect is important. In Instagram's case the mobile phone-only usecase standardized square format limited set of filters and editing tools made it super simple to edit and share images. Fewer decisions. Easier to scan and consume. Lower variability in format and structure. The focus is on the subject and the message.,A bit like memes. Fake art real messages.,So what's the next part of the photography stack to be standardized?,Any manual human process that requires knowledge time and experience to get right.,Let's start with composition.,Composition,Filters can help make a photo more interesting but great composition is the base of a great image. Composing a good image is hard. It takes a good eye and while an eye can be developed it takes time and effort. There's a reason why photography instruction courses manuals and photowalks are big businesses and great revenue sources for many photographers: learning to take a good photo takes time.,But it's also something that's hard to productize.,It's hard to program a camera to help someone take a better picture in real time. To get someone to think about the rule of thirds and change where they position the subject (grid lines are a start of course). It's hard to get someone to think about where they are positioning the subject and pay attention to the broader frame (the square format helps a bit with this). It's hard to get someone to crouch down choose a different angle move their feet all to find a more interesting viewpoint.,And that's why I think we'll soon see apps that productize the photographic eye and standardize composition.,Editing,We're undergone a revolution in how and why we share images. The next value-add will be in helping us figure out what to do with these images. "Editing" will move from editing individual images and toward editing series of images or in an easier-to-understand sense towardstorytelling.,If you look through the popular images on Instagram it can be a shock: very few of them are traditionally "good" images. But they're great messages. And sometimes they're great stories.,But as individual images they're still only snippets of stories.,tech,vine,instagram,sharing,images,video,filtering, , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrg4qoTbG1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This year's conference seeks to bring fresh historical themes and tools to bear on the problem of 'Architecture and the Street'. New research promises to enrich and challenge perspectives pioneered by Spiro Kostof Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte.

By adapting depth sensors to provide accurate 3D tracking of the human body and using two sensors in each bathroom Ideal Standard has been able to build a detailed picture of how people actually use their bathroom space.,It's a tale of neglected baths and bidets conflicting bathroom etiquette and maddening illogically arranged bathroom suites.,The findings supplemented with quantitative data gathered from 4000 people will be revealed today at ISH 2013 in Frankfurt.,Behind the data lie some fascinating glimpses into family life: the parents who seek refuge from their families with long baths and showers; the bathrooms that double up as laundries and dressing rooms; the flatmates forced to do their ablutions in unison.,According to the findings 40% of us crave a new bathroom but interestingly for the most part it's not a bigger space that we lust after; just a space that better meets our needs.,"We started with a hypothesis that in many homes the bathroom is not used as well as it could be" said Kerris Bright Chief Marketing Officer of Ideal Standard International.,"The findings seem to confirm what we suspected. Renovating a bathroom often starts with excitement and ends in disappointment. It's hard to know where to start and harder to see past the limitations of the room.",The publication of the study coincides with the launch of Ideal Standard's new marketing campaign; A Beautiful Use of Space. The campaign features a series of abstract bathroom spaces – a far cry from the usual imagery of scented candles and infinity baths looking out onto lush forests – to capture the different needs a bathroom meets in a day; invigoration transformation relaxation and play.,Families from Germany France Italy and the UK participated in the study representing a variety of households from single occupancy to multi-generational homes.,From Rotherham to Wuppertal; from Milan to Paris the families agreed to let their every movement in the bathroom be captured analysed and scrutinised by Ideal Standard researchers.,The results of the quantitative and qualitative studies will be analysed over the coming months but already some fascinating insights are emerging which will help Ideal Standard and its design teams innovate for the future.,"We conducted the study because uniquely our product range spans every aspect of bathroom design" said Kerris Bright.

But if you ask Leon and Lim their success was just one happy circumstance after another really.,As part of their "Fashion at FIAF" series the French Institute Alliance Francaise asked Pamela Golbin Chief Curator for the Fashion and Textiles collections at Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris to moderate a talk featuring the duo that covered everything from their high school experiences (Leon was Homecoming King of his High School Lim voted "Most Likely to Succeed") to their meeting at UC Berkley that would ultimately lead to their success as a pair today.,It all started of course with Opening Ceremony. While working corporate jobs in Manhattan during their mid-twenties Leon and Lim took a two week vacation to Hong Kong where the store would be born. They had bonded over a mutual love of shopping and travel and wanted to create a job where they could do both. Though neither had studied fashion Leon says they were lucky to be "naive" enough to believe they could just launch the venture and return to their corporate jobs if they failed.,"Lucky" is actually a pretty accurate term to describe the birth of Opening Ceremony: in post-9/11 New York City SUNY college was offering free business courses so the pair had a professor help put together their business plan. "I think he still uses it in class to this day" said Lim. They found their Howard Street location–at the time totally quiet and devoid of any retail–on a walk to SoHo from their weekly Chinatown dim sum lunch where they discussed their plans for the store.,They chose the name "Opening Ceremony" because they wanted a name you couldn't make fun of (rejected ideas included "Airport" and "Terminal"). "'Ceremony' is a very pretty word" explained Leon "and by the time you're done saying 'Opening Ceremony' the joke isn't funny anymore anyway.",Launching the Opening Ceremony clothing line happened almost by accident as well. Lim explained that when they opened the store they only bought special or fun clothes–"Sometimes it's too much fun" she said–and they needed what they called "basics plus" to fill in more practical needs. They "forced" their moms to become their seamstresses and make things to sell in the store. Leon and Lim didn't realize their in-house line was a hit until they had several other retailers knocking on their door to sell Opening Ceremony goods.,© Michael George,But if they had more or less fallen into their successes with Opening Ceremony Leon and Lim have taken a much more intentional approach at Kenzo. When considering what move they would make next Lim says they would only consider working with a brand they could do "our way–which is really 100% involved.",Admitting that they've benefited from not knowing "the rules" of fashion design upon joining the Kenzo team the pair forced the Parisian atelier to break everything down to basics–sometimes literally in the case of tearing down the walls of the office to create a more open-plan style of working.,Luckily (there's that word again!) it worked. Lim said that though the Kenzo employees were initially annoyed by the changes they warmed to the duo's style of design. "Seeing you guys walk around [the office] reminds us of when Kenzo was here" one employee who'd been there since the days of the label's namesake had told her.,And in just over a year Leon and Lim have taken the label from relative obscurity to must-have status. But they're not calling it just yet. "We feel there's so much more work to do" Leon humbly added when asked about the quick success of Kenzo.,Still one wonders after retail and design domination what can be left for the friends to conquer? Though they admitted to being very busy they shared that they still have areas that they're passionate about and could one day enter into–food and hotels being among them and different types of retail that Lim would only coyly say are "as exciting as what we're doing now.",But they'd like to clear one thing up first: Despite the general consensus of the fashion community Leon and Lim don't think they're very cool at all.,"We're actually the biggest nerds ever" Leon said.,http://bit.ly/112Cqpi, , , , , , , , , ,fashion,opening ceremony,youth, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrssgB2Dk1s75lgto1_250.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:MGP_9254-300x200.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But soft robots are also getting closer to becoming what are in effect mechanically agile medical devices that can "monitor your insides" in the words of Sangbae Kim assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT as reprinted by Popular Science sneaking around inside your body like an earthworm.  The so-called "meshworm" is exactly that: a robotic "worm" made from layered wire mesh that uses "nickel-titanium alloy for muscles." The application of a high temperature "shortens the wire tightens the spring's coil and squeezes that body segment." Thus "when a segment contracts the one behind it stretches out and the robot inches forward. The tendon also has muscles attached so the robot can turn left or right."  The result is the oddly grotesque and somewhat phallic creeping machine you see in the short video above. The idea is that this could be used for medical diagnosis or vascular surgery.  However the architectural or broadly spatial uses of this technology are also worth considering including the potential for monumentally scaled-up versions of the meshworm capable of assisting human or material transport through the built environment-a kind of peristaltic package-delivery tube that could replace the much-discussed pneumatic tubes of an earlier urban era. Like something out of a David Cronenberg film the city would have a kind of giant bowel-infrastructure distributing waste material from point to point. More interestingly though this new class of soft robots and meshworms could quickly assume their roles as architectural explorers in their own right burrowing through collapsed buildings passing beneath or around doors even being taken up by the more ambitious burglars and tactical operations teams of the world.  Or for example earlier this month in the cave state of Kentucky the annual "Cave City Hamfest" explored how to bring radio transmission deep underground. This was "accomplished by placing handheld (relay capable) walkie-talkies or relay boxes along a cave passage." "After the inital debugging phase we demonstrated the ability to simply walk the cave until data was lost and then backing up a few feet for a solid link. Then placing a radio on a convenient rock and continuing." Taking this as our cue we could simply wire-up a team of meshworms with radio repeaters and send a small crawling team of spelunking robots far ahead of us into caves where no human body can fit; they would crawl until they lose a signal move back a few feet to re-establish a secure feed and then the next one squirms dutifully forward.  You've thus built a mobile semi-autonomous deep-earth radio network made from repurposed medical devices-equal parts cave-mapping expedition and subterranean pirate radio station-opening up whole new realms of underground exploration (and tactical media). http://bit.ly/WsYvtt, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,bldgblog,robot,tech, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrsseMa1r1s75lgto1_r1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

To create metamuseum.tumblr.com a multi-museum multi-curator Tumblr @MADMuseum I saw it as a kind of curatorial game: Show Me What You've Got.,I've written several times about Tumblr as a platform for everyday interactions with museums archives and other collections of visual and historical artifacts (see here hereand most recently here in "Shopping With Sandro"). One of the benefits of museum Tumblrs and similar projects like the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's Object of the Day is the potential they have to surface items in the collection that have not been exhibited for years to hold them up next to more current and popular objects and see what connections happen. The Tumblr can be like a sketch of curation cheaper and less consequential than an exhibit; or deeper and wonkier on a particular even personal topic.When I was asked by Jake Yuzna and Dan Rubinstein to contribute ideas to the Museum of Arts and Design's spring public series on the theme After the Museum a Tumblr was the first thing that sprang to mind. One of the aspects that intrigues me about the platform is the potential for lightness visual jokes and play. I decided to structure my Tumblr as a curatorial game of free association (and potentially one-upmanship). As the editor I set the themes 13 in total. Then I sent them out to curators of design architecture decorative arts and crafts collections across the United States essentially saying Show me what you've got. I defined design in the broadest terms in hopes of getting some unusual neighbors and I put the start date at 1850 where the architectural historians like to begin modernism. Marking sampler (Dresden Germany 1834) Embroidered on cotton. (courtesy Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum)In December I invited more than two dozen curators geographically dispersed to participate. By January 13 had agreed to send me five to ten objects from their collections in response to my themes. I must to thank all of the participants for fitting this project into their busy schedules and for being good sports: Zoe Ryan Art Institute of Chicago; Rachel Delphia Carnegie Museum of Art; Ellen Lupton Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum; Darrin Alfred Denver Art Museum; Mel Buchanan Milwaukee Art Museum; Jennifer Komar Olivarez Minneapolis Institute of Arts; Lyndsay Bratton Museum of Arts and Design; Sarah Margolis-Pineo Museum of Contemporary Craft; Emily Zilber Museum of Fine Arts Boston; Paola Antonelli and Barbara Eldredge Museum of Modern Art; Lena Vigna Racine Art Museum; Andrew Blauvelt Walker Art Center; and Ivana Rodriguez The Wolfsonian-FIU. Sophie May and Reply coordinated and designed the Tumblr at MAD. The curator's texts make fascinating mini-histories and take many different approaches to defining an object. Opening the emails with the images attached was like a virtual Christmas morning (if you are a collections nerd).John McQueen Untitled 1994. Tulip poplar bark and plastic rivets. (courtesy Racine Art Museum)The result launched this week at metamuseum.tumblr.com. If you are on Tumblr please follow for 13 weeks of fascinating objects seven days a week. If you're not on Tumblr I would suggest checking in on weekends when you'll be able to see all the objects that illustrate each theme. @MADMuseum will also be tweeting the items daily. I won't reveal all of the themes since discovery is part of the fun but I will say they run from Alphabet to Year One (something from the year of the museum's founding). The images in this post are all responses to the Alphabet theme and give a good sense of the project's diversity. At its end I hope the Tumblr will serve as a discussion-provoking survey of modern and contemporary design and will foster other posts (in visual or verbal form) on what we might learn from this collaborative experiment. Coincidentally the editors of art blog Hyperallergic are sponsoring The World's First Tumblr Art Symposium on March 9 in Brooklyn. I would attend if I could. Leading up to it they have published a series of essays analyzing the intersection of art artists museums and Tumblr posted here.George C. Blickensderfer (American 1850-1917) Model 6 portable typewriter c. 1906 aluminum steel. (courtesyMinneapolis Institute of Arts)Also this week I reviewed a tiny new exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art "Plain or Fancy? Restraint and Exuberance in the Decorative Arts" for the Culture Desk blog at the New Yorker. Drawn from the Met's European decorative arts collections this is the kind of exhibition that would work very well on Tumblr. The Met decided instead to put it on Twitter @PlainorFancy and there are a pair of iPads in the gallery for viewers to vote up or down on their taste for severity v. ostentation. (The results are not encouraging so far.) As I say in the review "I tried really I did" to like some of the things on the fancy side. And I learned an onomatopoeic new vocabulary word "prunt.",http://bit.ly/15betJe, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,tumblr, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjruusnNui1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:37728-marking_sampler_1981_525.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:37728-Alphabet_525.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:37728-Alphabet_Blickensderfer_525.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Whether it's Lady Gaga's Fame or the early-20th-century classic Chanel No. 5 now promoted by Brad Pitt the focus is typically on the shape of the bottle the color of the packaging and the images of romance - or celebrity - constructed by a marketing department.,But there is another way to appreciate fragrance: as a pure art form born near the turn of the 20th century like Modernism itself. That at least is the vision of Chandler Burr the curator in charge of the two-year-old department of olfactory art at the Museum of Arts and Design.,"The fundamental goal of the department" Mr. Burr said during a recent interview at his office "is placing scent as an artistic medium alongside painting sculpture and music." For however "brilliant" or "extraordinary" the greatest scents may be he added "they're not recognized as works of art and the artists who create them are not recognized as artists." Mr. Burr who wrote the 2003 book "The Emperor of Scent" andused to write about fragrances for The New York Times aims to change that when he opens his first show at the museum on Tuesday.,Called "The Art of Scent 1889-2012" (through Feb. 24) the exhibition will use 12 fragrances to chart the evolution of modern perfumery starting with Aimé Guerlain's Jicky (1889) among the first to blend synthetic with natural ingredients and continuing through Chanel No. 5 (1921) created by the great perfumer Ernest Beaux and generally considered the first modern fragrance to contemporary scents like Olivier Cresp's cotton candy-scented Angel (1992) which Mr. Burr described as "a work of beautiful overt Surrealism.",Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the show is its spare installation designed by the architects Diller Scofidio & Renfro. While most scent exhibitions - there have been a smattering over the years though rarely at mainstream museums - rely on displays of packaging or raw ingredients visitors to this one will enter a minimalistic white cube whose walls dispense puffs of fragrance. The labels projected on the walls will name each scent as well as the perfumer who created it (until fairly recently their names were known only within the trade). And the wall texts will describe each scent in terms typically reserved for visual art and architecture like Modernist abstract or Brutalist.,"To a degree it's a problem of language" Mr. Burr said. "We have not had anything other than a marketing language applied to these works." Using terminology associated with established art forms he added "will allow us to understand these works and their aesthetics and what they communicate and why they exist.",When asked to speak more straightforwardly about what particular fragrances smell like - citrus say or sandalwood - Mr. Burr became inflamed.,"I am completely opposed to this idiotic reductionism of works of olfactory art to their raw materials which is as stupid as reducing a Frank Gehry building to the kind of metal the kind of wood and the kind of glass that he used" Mr. Burr proclaimed.,The olfactory art department came about after Mr. Burr proposed the concept to Holly Hotchner the director of the museum. It struck Ms. Hotchner that fragrance was analogous to photography which even into the 1970s was seen as "a very different venture from art" she said.,She also saw fragrance as a perfect fit with the overall program of the museum which has explored some fairly radical approaches to art and design. Previous shows have focused on subjects like handmade bicycles and contemporary art made from organic materials like chicken bones insects or spices; visitors are often encouraged to smell or touch examples of the materials used.,"People who know us kind of expect that when they come here - to learn something new to see something new" Ms. Hotchner said. "This will definitely be in the vein of experiencing something new.",After Mr. Burr joined the museum he and Ms. Hotchner began figuring out how to translate an extraordinarily evanescent art form - one that is typically encountered on the skin or lingering in the air - into the visually oriented context of a museum.,That challenge appealed to Liz Diller a partner in Diller Scofidio & Renfro the firm best known for the High Line in Chelsea and the Lincoln Center redevelopment project. "The real excitement and lure" of designing the scent exhibition she said was in figuring out "how to make this work in a place that privileges vision as the master sense.",The firm had worked on experimental projects like the Blur Buildingat the 2002 Swiss National Expo a pavilion on Lake Neuchâtel that was essentially made of mist created by high-pressure water jets and the 2010 exhibition "How Wine Became Modern" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art where visitors could inhale the scents of wine from open carafes. This time "we didn't want to show perfume bottles we didn't want to focus on videos of the scent artists talking we didn't want it to be a kind of exploratorium" Ms. Diller said. "We really wanted to suck everything out of that place except the scent.",The solution they arrived at involved creating a gallery with 12 gently curved indentations in its walls. Hidden behind each is a scent diffusion machine: a visitor who leans into the curve will set off an electronic eye causing the machine to release a burst of fragrance calibrated to stay in place for four seconds without spreading across the room. (Made by the German company Scentcommunication the machines are typically used in industry trade shows; this is the first time organizers believe that they have been used in a museum.),There will also be a "more social" space as Ms. Diller put it where visitors can dip strips of blotter paper into petri dishes filled with the 12 fragrances in the show and to experience various stages in the development of a 13th Sophia Grojsman's 1990 Trésor via peel-and-sniff cards. But for the most part she added her firm's focus was on making a "wall full of machinery and effects look like there's almost nothing there.",As for Ms. Hotchner and Mr. Burr their biggest challenge may have been corralling the international cosmetics companies and scent makers whose aid they sought in financing the department and putting together its first show. "This was a totally new idea for them that scents would be presented without marketing and packaging" Ms. Hotchner said adding that "it was a longer journey than we'd imagined.",Nonetheless they stuck to their guns refusing to offer guarantees of inclusion in shows - or placement in the gift shop - to companies that gave them help. (The first to come on board was Estée Lauder a longtime supporter of the museum.),Of the 11 companies and groups that are now listed as sponsors of the show eight have scents on display; they are listed on the wall labels as lenders.  (In this context lending really means giving: throughout the run lenders will donate essential oils for the scent diffusion machines - about enough to produce nearly 600 100-milliliter bottles of eau de toilette.) The only fragrances sold in the museum will be packaged with the catalog which  combines essays by Mr. Burr with small pharmaceutical-style bottles of each fragrance. (The cost is likely to be about $250.),scent,exhibition,art, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrvjswaEy1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The 60-year-old model and daughter of Ingrid Bergman charmed us with her candid talk about plastic surgery ("Is it the new foot binding?") and about how her life has changed in the industry as she's gotten older. (Rossellini famously claimed she lost her Lancome contract in 1996 for being "too old."),Sadly Isabella wasn't at our screening - we would have fangirled out for sure - but luckily the Italian model and actress has a new set of ads to give us our fix. Rossellini 60 stars in a new Bulgari campaign for her latest collection of Isabella Rossellini for Bulgari bags as reported by Women's Wear Daily.,The model looks stunning in the spots shot by Annie Leibovitz who alsophotographed Rossellini for that famous portrait with David Lynch back in 1986.Here she does the same black-dress-halfway-off-the-shoulder thing but this time instead of a man covered in a turtleneck she brandishes a gorgeous red handbag one of her signature pieces that will be available for fall and spring. Can we place our order?,Rossellini's ads will appear in the September issue of Vanity Fair. Psst Isabella: we won't tell Lancome (and… Burt's Bees?) that you've switched fashion teams., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,fashion,age,women, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrvv0zdgb1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They're a fashion label whose founders come from a background in interaction designer and architecture which has given them a unqiue perspective when it comes to how they designs their garments. Their approach is to utilize the hive mind of the internet along with web applications to allow consumers to create their own designs using software.,Coming across like a Google Chrome experiment their DIY little black dress D.dress allows users to create their own version of this wardrobe staple by drawing it on a model using triangulated forms. Advancing on this theme of crowdsourcing the design process is their latest project CONSTRVCT which allows users to create their own clothes using an online app with a 3D interface. "When you're building something like this do you build the platform or do you build the object?" asks Huang. "We choose to build the platform because of the creative force of the community.",CONSTRVCT,With this new computational shared design process Huang notes how it combines the experimental creativity of the catwalk with the practical issues (like sizing etc.) of the high street-allowing users access to a third path that breaks down the previous barriers and points to a future where anyone can create their own collection in the same way anyone can make their own music or video using readily available digital tools.,ENTER OUR CONTEST FOR A CHANCE TO WIN YOUR CONSTRVCT DESIGN!,We're offering you the chance to win your very own CONSTRVCT design!

That includes diversity of all life experiences including gender. Women were some of the first programmers and continue to make a major impact on the programming world today. We think it's important to highlight the great work women are doing in computer science to help provide role models for young women thinking about careers in computing. Tomorrow is International Women's Day and as one of our contributions to the celebration we're proud to support Voices Global Conference presented by Global Tech Women. As part of this 24-hour live streamed event Google will provide more than a dozen hours of free talks featuring women working in computer science beginning today. To access the full schedule and our ongoing broadcasts see our section on the Voices website which will be updated throughout the day. The Voices Global Conference is the brainchild of Global Tech Women's founder Deanna Kosaraju who also started India's Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2010 with grant support from Google. The India conferences which provide a forum for women to share their professional and research work in computing have grown rapidly with more than 800 attendees in 2012. So when Deanna proposed this global 24-hour streamed conference we knew it was a great opportunity to help women and other audiences around the world learn more and get inspired about the contributions women are making to technology and computer science. Our sessions will feature a range of material from new episodes of the Women Techmakers series and interviews with women leaders like the head of Lexity India Mani Abrol to discussions focusing on technologies like Google Compute Engine. For a sneak peek of the type of content we'll be providing check out Pavni's story below produced in conjunction with PBS' MAKERS series. I've provided advice to many young people in India interested in studying computer science and pursuing their own dreams-so Pavni's tenacity coupled with the encouragement and support she received from her father resonated with me. We're excited to share her story and others like it alongside technical conversations and discussions on women in technology as part of this conference.  I hope you'll join us for our sessions-and in the meantime you can learn more about our efforts to support women at Google and beyond.Posted by Beryl Nelson Software Engineering Managerhttp://bit.ly/Xt0MFG, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,the official google blog,tech,women in tech,emily wood,conference, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrw8w5BDm1s75lgto1_r1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:13J697s, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

(NASDAQ: SSYS) today announce a collaboration with KOR EcoLogic to produce URBEE 2 the first road-ready fuel-efficient car built using 3D printing or additive manufacturing technologies. Targeted to hit the road in two years URBEE 2 represents a significant milestone in the world of traditional assembly-line manufacturing.,"A future where 3D printers build cars may not be far off after all" said Jim Bartel Stratasys vice president of RedEye On Demand. "Jim Kor and his team at KOR EcoLogic had a vision for a more fuel-efficient car that would change how the world approaches manufacturing and today we're achieving it. URBEE 2 shows the manufacturing world that anythingreally is possible. There are few design challenges additive manufacturing capabilities can't solve.",The KOR EcoLogic team will fully design URBEE 2 in CAD files sending them to RedEye On Demand for building through Stratasys' Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. This unique process applies thermoplastics in layers from the bottom up yielding parts that are durable precise and repeatable. The finished two-passenger vehicle will comprise 40 large intricate 3D-printed parts compared to hundreds of parts in the average car. The strong lightweight vehicle will be designed to go 70 mph on the freeway using a biofuel like 100 percent ethanol. The goal is for URBEE 2 to drive from San Francisco to New York City on only 10 gallons of fuel setting a new world record.,"As a mechanical engineer I've always believed we could use technology to help us solve some of society's greatest challenges like minimizing our dependence on oil and reducing ozone emissions. How cool is it that American manufacturing can evolve to tackle these challenges head-on? Our team is excited to launch URBEE 2 putting a next-generation vehicle on the road that will eventually be sold to the public" said Jim Kor president and senior designer for Winnipeg-based KOR EcoLogic.,URBEE 2 which stands for urban electric follows in the tracks of its conceptual predecessor Urbee 1. Produced in 2011 as a partnership between KOR EcoLogic Stratasys and RedEye On Demand Urbee 1 proved that 3D printing could in fact produce large strong parts that meet accurate specifications of a car body. URBEE 2 will take the basic concepts of Urbee 1 to a higher level including features like a fully functioning heater windshield wipers and mirrors.,"With the Urbee 1 project I learned that product design is nearly unencumbered by considerations on how parts can be made with digital manufacturing.

Based on the biomechanical data custom spike plates the part of the shoe that actually connects with the ground are created.,The new process was first reported by Wired magazine on Wednesday.,Right now this process is only for New Balance elite sponsored athletes but said Katherine Petrecca the company's business manager of studio innovation that will change with time. "The technology is early and our implementation is still really in a very early phase but you can envision as the technology improves and capacity increases - and cost comes down - the audience who will benefit from customisation will just grow and grow and grow. This will get down eventually to the casual athlete.",Some top runners helped in the development: 1500-meter World Champion gold medalist Jenny Barringer Simpson 2012 US Olympian Kim Conley 2012 British Olympian Barbara Parker and All-American runner Jack Bolas.,A bonus? The addition of the athlete's signature to the plate as if they were signing an autograph noted Chris Wawrousek studio innovation lead designer.,It wasn't singularly demand or technology that drove the development of the technique said Wawrousek studio innovation lead designer it was the idea that the industry is at a watershed moment thanks to both demand and technology. "It feels like a new industrial revolution in some ways. We're no longer limited by scale to produce a product and customization can be totally practical" he said.,The athletes themselves were another factor. "It almost never happens that you put an athlete in a shoe and they don't have some comment about it" Wawrousek added. "In this case we can have an athlete say 'This one particular spike is in the wrong place. Can you move it?' In this case we can say 'Yes!",Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

For one thing the Armory Show's Focus section with energetic crowds and sales wasn't this year's sideshow.,"People seem to be buying a lot in the young section" said art advisor Wendy Cromwell.,Twenty minutes into the fair's preview Focus galleries were already reporting strong sales. "The first thing we sold was this Paul Gabrielli box to John Waters" said Invisible-Exports co-owner Benjamin Tischer pointing to a chained-up cardboard box that went for $6500. The gallery also sold two of the artist's wooden soap-dish sculptures.,Next door meanwhile Monique Meloche had already sold Joel Ross and Jason Kreps's photograph of a desolate Illinois landscape for $7500 plus a neon work by collective Type A and an installation of bronze-plated shoes by Kendell Carter.,Connersmith gallery was offering Lincoln Schatz's photographs of American innovators for $5000 each but a collector had placed the entire set of 89 on hold. Across the way Gagosian's booth of Warhol paintings brought star power to this subsection of the fair.,Despite the buzz at Focus big-ticket sales were few and far between. Modestly priced works however like 32-year-old TM Davy's lush paintings of candles at Eleven Rivington were selling fast. The gallery sold all 20 paintings in three hours the works priced between $2500 and $3500. Kavi Gupta Gallery sold two ink-stained canvases by James Krone for $6000 each as well as a paint-splattered fabric work by Angel Otero for $35000.,The lower price points suggest a shift in the Armory Show's collector base according to art advisors. With the arrival of Frieze New York which returns to Randall's Island for its sophomore edition in May blue-chip buyers may not feel the need to shop at the piers. Still said Cromwell "collectors who are buying new artists are all here.",Major international dealers most of which are also participating in Frieze New York this spring did manage to secure a handful of marquee sales. "Let's just say we'll be rehanging tomorrow" dealer Sean Kelly said. Lisson sold a maroon fiberglass disk by Anish Kapoor for $455350 and a grisaille canvas covered with sandpaper by Allora & Calzadilla for $125000. Victoria Miro sold a glistening blue and black web painting by Yayoi Kusama for $400000. Sprüth Magers sold three works by George Condo - two works on paper for $45000 and one painting for $250000 - as well as a shaggy yarn sculpture by Rosemarie Trockel for $228000.,Two of three grainy soft-focused video installations of flower bouquets by Diana Thater also sold at David Zwirner. Priced at $150000 both went to private collectors. That one of them has an art foundation pleased Thater who was at the booth. "I don't like my work disappearing" she said. "I like it to go to institutions and museums so it can be seen.",Smaller New York galleries noted the fair marked a welcome return to business as usual. "We're back to being dealers as opposed to hurricane victims" said Ed Winkleman.,To see photos click on the slideshow.,,http://bit.ly/WvDm1C, , , , , ,artinfo,art,julia halperin,youth, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjryc4x7jP1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:ZQJSik, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The empirical basis for inferring bricks' intentions is well established comprising building traditions that have evolved over millennia. For newer materials the chance of moving from laboratories to construction sites can be a crapshoot. The successful ones not only capture markets but transform behavior.,The most promising approaches materials specialists agree emphasize integration rather than isolation. "We don't just create materials or products; we create information systems" says architect/author Blaine Brownell who co-directs the MS in Sustainable Design program at the University of Minnesota and whose most recent book Material Strategies: Innovative Applications in Architecture (Princeton Architectural Press 2012) links innovations in minerals concrete wood metal glass and plastics to prominent case studies. Using the term hypermaterial to denote the convergence of materials and information processing Brownell looks to the management of light energy and data as the leading edge of materials research.,COURTESY JENNY SABIN,Jason O. Vollen associate director of the Center for Architecture Science and Ecology (CASE) a joint project of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and SOM heralds "a fundamental paradigm shift from moving energy mechanically which is how we do it now to moving energy materially." Instead of multiple layers of a structure performing different functions Vollen says as in Mike Davies' concept of the polyvalent wall "We think one layer should do multiple things; we think a potential solution is the multivalent material. That's not so far off; it's speculative fiction rather than science fiction." Citing the "holy grail" of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Stephen Selkowitz-a material optimizing both daylight and insulation-Vollen says "what exists now won't do that but what exists around the corner might." Nanotechnology where categories blend and "metals can become more like glasses glasses become more like ceramics" he continues is yielding unprecedented control over properties such as heat flow and daylight transmittance. With high-performance ceramics in particular offering properties that answer climate-change-driven imperatives he is convinced "the industry is poised for a revolution.",Materials research is often a matter of systematic biomimicry invoking a parallel understanding of natural processes occurring over time on multiple scales from the nanoscale to the visible to the ecosystemic. "It's not about translating shape or a static image of a biological behavior" says Jenny E. Sabin assistant professor of architecture at Cornell and a founding member of Cecil Balmond's Nonlinear Systems Organization. As the architectural member of the National Science Foundation-sponsored ESkin interdisciplinary team which also includes a materials scientist a cell biologist and a systems engineer Sabin investigates homologies in materials geometries and forms. She describes her challenge as "thinking about how those properties could work across scales" and replicating them in "highly engineered sustainable materials that have very sophisticated responses to environmental cues.",COURTESY JENNY SABIN,Generative models based on cellular activity inform her "Branching Morphogenesis" installation at Linz Austria's 2009 Ars Electronica (comprising 75000 cable zip ties in tension organized according to microscale cellular forces) and her all-knitted myThread Pavilion for Nike's Flyknit Collective produced with New Jersey-based fabricator Shima Seiki USA. "It's not just that we can produce complex organic form" she continues but that designers can "directly interact with manufacturing technologies…Working with soft textile-based materials at a large scale is only possible through really cutting-edge fabrication technologies." Strategies that arise from these investigations include "embedding a more nonlinear lifespan" into a material so that products pass usefully through multiple life cycles; porosity allowing lightness and transmissibility as well as strength; geometries that repel or absorb water a high priority in materials that must endure sea-level rise; and self-organizing properties on nano-to-macro scales.,The technological transition suggested by business consultant David Morris vice president of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance-replacing the hydrocarbon-based economy with all its externalities costly extractive processes and resource-availability constraints with an older cleaner system "the once and future carbohydrate economy"-calls for more use of lifelike materials Brownell suggests: those derived from agriculture and those deriving knowledge from living systems. A brick may want to be thick but contemporary materials want to be smart.,Resource maximizers beginning with light,Andrew H. Dent PhD vice president of library and materials research at Material ConneXion sees two broad questions driving research in the field: what does Earth have in abundance and what are we running out of? To the extent that materials and processes based on ample readily available resources (from sunlight to silicon) replace those with sources in short supply (petroleum gold copper clean air and water) materials research represents a critical adaptation to emergent conditions.,Much of this work is economic optimization rather than new discovery Dent adds. Methods of developing biopolymers from a wide range of plants harvested in different regions and conditions (corn castor switch grass sugar cane potatoes and others) are already known. "The issue is how to beat out oil" he says which "even at a high price is still significantly cheaper." Tradeoffs of this sort are inevitable. A material may be lightweight enough that its production and transport save energy and yield an admirable overall ecological footprint but its components pose toxicity concerns as with ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE the transparent insulating "pillow" material seen in the 2008 Olympic Water Cube and other buildings worldwide). Biopolymers for construction consumer products or fuel likewise involve edible crops and thus compete with food production. "Back in 2006 and early '07" Brownell recalls "when there was so much excitement about biofuels and ethanol…states like Iowa were promising all kinds of fuel-making capacity without taking a hard look at how a lot of this corn that we make goes to developing countries in order to feed the world." Vollen frames this starkly as "a political and regulatory issue: 'if we replace oil with corn what do we eat?'",SENSITILE'S LIGHT-PIPING PANELS HARVEST AND MANIPULATE LIGHT THROUGH OPTICAL CHANNELS EMBEDDED IN CONCRETE AND RESIN SUBSTRATES.,COURTESY SENSITILE,In this regard viewing solar energy as the ultimate free resource Brownell is particularly enthusiastic about products that harvest and manipulate light such as Sensitile's light-piping panels embedding optical channels in concrete and resin substrates or a recent breakthrough at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering scattering silver nanocubes on a gold film to "help the substrate absorb virtually all the light…so incredibly efficiently that nothing leaves the surface" and improving the efficiency of sensors. Another promising use of multiwall carbon nanotubes he says is field-induced polymer electroluminescent (FIPEL) technology which generates a warm nonflickering wavelength resembling sunlight­-"that spectrum that clearly influences human behavior and productivity in workplaces and learning places." These flat lighting panels offer a distinct improvement over harsh compact fluorescents and heat-inefficient incandescents with efficiency approaching that of LEDs.  Developed at Wake Forest University and licensed for commercial development to CeeLite Technologies the panels can be integrated with flexible substrates and incorporated into windows or even textiles.,COURTESY SENSITILE,Brownell also cites the engineer/designer Akira Wakita's work with "conductive threads to make thermochromic and photochromic textiles that can act as computer monitors." The importance of lighting in the developing world he emphasizes makes it a promising field for leapfrogging technologies that address "the good but tough 99 percent question" about new materials' relevance to global populations as well as a generally fertile field for disruptive technologies. "I'm still marveling at how LEDs have transformed the whole lighting field" Brownell says. "It wasn't that long ago [that] it was kind of hard to find an LED.",Concrete the most widely used construction material on Earth is ripe for innovation. Its Portland cement component accounts for an estimated 5 percent of the global carbon footprint; by weight concrete is environmentally friendlier than metals or polymers Brownell says but its sheer prevalence means that improving its performance has considerable ecological effects. Strategies include reducing cement volume with additives like blast furnace slag or rice husk ash (practiced by the Canadian firm EcoSmart). Then there is Calera's carbonate mineralization by aqueous precipitation which diverts preheated flue gas into seawater combines energy production cement manufacture and carbon sequestration and enhances CO absorption by using magnesium silicate iron carbonate or other alternative components. This process is done by TecEco in Tasmania Novacem in London and CarbonCure in Nova Scotia. ("Concrete strikes me as something like molé" Brownell comments: "Every family has their own recipe."),Tensile strength is a concern with any concrete; among various high-performance crack-resistant concretes that use silica fume superplasticizers ground quartz or mineral fibers Victor Li's work at the University of Michigan with fiber-reinforced bendable concrete stretches the category's definition altogether. Lafarge's Ductal is another high-performance concrete that bridges the border between concretes and composites. A novel self-repair strategy developed at Newcastle University BacillaFilla programs a Bacillus subtilis strain to create calcium carbonate and a "microbial glue" when it is injected into cracks; it then cures to the same strength as the surrounding material (finally stopping thanks to a genetic "kill switch" that keeps the bugs from surviving once they detect a surface; this feature relieves hypothetical sci-fi concerns about an uncontrollable Bill Joy-style gray goo).,The prospect that concrete could move from carbon-positive to carbon-negative strikes many commentators as an achievable goal-provided the newer variants gain market share despite contractors' comfort level with current recipes. "What we need" suggests Dent "are some high-profile architects to use some of [the new] material and show its advantages by being part of a high-profile near-carbon-zero building.",VICTOR LI AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH FIBER-REINFORCED BENDABLE CONCRETE.,COURTESY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,Material moneyball,Untested novelties face market resistance particularly in areas where suboptimal technologies are entrenched easily available and (as Vollen points out) insurable. The factors that add up to successful technology transfer are far from systematic; for some materials decades passed between their invention and commercialization. Dent hails Gorilla Glass the ultra-strong scratch-resistant surface that allows durability and interactivity in smartphones as a transformative material that could also be useful in architecture. Yet when Corning developed the similar Chemcor glass in the early 1960s it mothballed the product after about a decade only to revive the idea on request from Apple in the mid-2000s. Serendipity and a suitable niche among related technologies appear essential for promising ideas to migrate from laboratory R&D to the Sweets catalog or the shelves of Home Depot.,One of nature's recurrent strategies for economizing on material bulk-porous forms-characterizes several materials whose properties have drawn attention. Metallic foams often aluminum or zinc combine strength with lightness and thermal resistance; one such product an aluminum foam marketed by the Canadian firm Cymat as SmartShield was originally developed as a blast barrier on the undersides of military vehicles that encounter roadside bombs. "An individual at Cymat who had an architectural background recognized that in addition to having the extreme technical properties the material was aesthetically interesting" reports Kelly Thomas spokesperson for its distributor Stone Source. Slightly altered in cell structure and slab thickness rebranded as Alusion the foam (80 percent air by volume) is now available to serve as walls partitions decorative fixtures acoustic drop ceilings or exterior cladding. Currently a specialty material Alusion could conceivably gain increased prominence after the opening of the 9/11 Museum where it will appear on the undersides of the twin fountains.,architecture,material,concrete,glass,aerogel,hypermaterial,information processing,light, , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjt85qKAS71s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_02.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_06.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_18.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_10.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_15.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_14.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_16.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_01.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_05.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:new_materials_04.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,

Billions and billions of tons of material in the global economy are tied directly to the manufacturing of building products. Yet the identity of these materials remain a mystery throughout much of the supply chain to most consumers. Reliable data at all levels of production and consumption are essential to improving their performance.,"Materials are not what they used to be" says Michael Bell a Columbia University architecture professor who chairs the school's Conferences on Architecture Engineering and Materials. "Materials in some senses are becoming continuous stratums of amortized risk.",In other words the chemical stuff that makes up our physical things is often well-researched in its raw form but barely understood in terms of its life span. That fact doesn't bode well for an architect interested in the health safety and welfare of society at large-namely for all architects. As life-cycle thinking becomes more prominent in design architects need to know more about materials than their strength appearance and cost. They need to be aware of the production processes recycling potential and associated ecological and environmental hazards that may lurk beneath the surface. Diving to this depth of material culture so to speak creates a premium for detailed chemical information.,Popular design and building standards have revealed a certain amount of information already: LEED the EPA's Design for the Environment program California's Safer Consumer Products Regulation the Cradle to Cradle certification of McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry assorted "red lists" such as that of the Living Building Challenge and other standards highlight material hazards and viable alternatives. At the same time the material supply chain has grown unprecedentedly complex.,Innovation in production processes means that novel materials are capable of broader functionality. Zaha Hadid Hon. FAIA's Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg Germany for instance would be inconceivable without Agilia an extremely fluid concrete that can be poured in a single shot without vibration to smooth it out. If vibration is eliminated from the curing process it stands that Agilia might have a much broader range of applications. In addition increased overseas sourcing means less control for American specifiers raising serious questions for architects: Are the suppliers compliant with standards? Are they fully aware of what's entered a product upstream? Is the bill of materials (BoM) accurate?,It's also important to be critical of greenwashing. A product may be labeled "VOC-free" but knowing that it contains no volatile organic compounds isn't the same as knowing what it does contain. What do those contents do to bodies and environments? Accidents (lethal and nonlethal) do happen.,With or without advanced chemical training architects face a bewildering field of overlapping standards and must navigate a research base that experts describe as vast uneven and ever-changing. Structured databases are needed to allow users to evaluate data and make informed choices. Organizations that are creating online tools to help fill this niche include Perkins+Will (P+W) which opened its free Transparency database last November; the Pharos Project an open-source evaluation system launched in 2006 by the Healthy Building Network; and SciVera a private business-to-business venture which marshals the expertise of board-certified toxicologists to evaluate research and help all participants in supply chains match value systems with BoM information even when that information is proprietary.,P+W's Transparency (transparency.perkinswill.com) is the first free database of substances commonly found in building materials which are either known or highly suspected of being detrimental to the health of humans and the environment. P+W contends that it is appropriate to apply the precautionary principle when selecting and specifying products and materials in light of the potential lasting impact of such materials on the users of facilities it designs. Rather than use products which contain these substances in keeping with the precautionary principle it will seek out alternatives in an effort to counter reported health effects and protect the health of future generations. P+W's Paula Vaughan AIA and Diana Davis AIA cite a 2005 Environmental Working Group study "Body Burden: the Pollution in Newborns" which found that out of 287 foreign substances in umbilical-cord blood from Red Cross samples 250 were directly tied to building products.,"From a healthcare standpoint" Davis says "our clients have typically been more focused on what microbes materials encourage and harbor than about the inherent health or toxicity of the product itself. We're just now starting to be able to provide that additional level of sophisticated knowledge about materials.",Perkins+Will's sustainability specialists have developed lists of common asthma triggers flame retardants and documented or highly suspect carcinogens. Transparency fills a unique void for architectural practice in between a dearth of centralized information sources specifically for design professionals and the reluctance to "do full scientific research every time we were specifying carpet" Vaughan notes. Davis and Vaughan also endorse the Pharos Project (pharosproject.net) begun by the advocacy group Healthy Building Network in 2000 as a broad collection of related product information congruent with other organizations' research such as BuildingGreen's GreenSpec environmentally preferable products list. Pharos emerged from the International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge a certification program that centers on materials research New Urbanist planning principals biophilic theory (à la E.O. Wilson) and social-justice goals. In terms of materials Pharos centralizes multiple third-party product-certification systems compares their levels of analytical rigor and specifies 16 substances or substance categories that must be addressed for a building to meet its standard.,Pharos compiles one of several so-called "red lists" of harmful materials to be avoided which tend to overlap and in aggregate confuse more than clarify. The Healthy Building Network has one; so does Google; and the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) is trying out the idea with its new Pilot Credit 11 on chemical avoidance. What makes Pharos stand out is its red yellow and green ratings which help decode and filter the complications of multiple standards.,There's a language barrier between different parties in the product chain in other words but there are also a lot of blind corners. SciVera (scivera.com) a three-year-old Charlottesville Va.–based company might have the solution. SciVera is the partnership of urban planner and management consultant Joseph Rinkevich and board-certified toxicologist Thomas Osimitz. Their Web-based SciVera Lens analytic tools have begun attracting attention in design and construction for their ability to provide material information inexpensively and in two scalable ways: SciVera Lens provides a platform to companies for efficient collection of product material and chemical data while also automating the toxological risk-assessment and reporting process.,Architectural materials and products Rinkevich says represent an important growth area for SciVera which already documents materials in automotive interiors toys and electronics as well as specialty chemicals. The company's expansion into outdoor equipment and household goods is under way. This may seem like a lot to take on but the materials and chemicals assessed in one domain frequently appear in another Osimitz says.,The firm has also begun integrating a material-tracking system used in the Chinese toy industry raising the possibility that the SciVera Lens system could interface with building information modeling (BIM) systems in the future as well. Both Osimitz and Rinkevich say that such a step is technically feasible.,SciVera can respond to evolving research faster than list-based approaches. "Lists for most part are developed on the basis of science that usually occurred five or 10 years ago" Osimitz says "so they are lagging indicators of safety to humans and the environment." SciVera incorporates red-list information into its software-it's useful stuff after all-but tracks potential interactions as well.,"Because we're primarily a science-based team as opposed to a data-based team we have a group of toxicologists that review the current literature and asks 'Does a given chemical have the same kind of properties as another chemical that is already on a red or restricted substance list?' " Osimitz asks. "We allow people not just to see the current picture but to give insight into the likelihood that chemicals not currently on restricted lists could be included on such lists down the road.",SciVera's procedures are designed to address two of the pervasive problems with existing chemical-assessment processes: incompatibility and lack of credibility. For data compatibility SciVera's Web-based platform enables companies to easily and securely import product and material data for assessment. SciVera ensures credibility by disclosing to its customers all details of each assessment.,But the company's approach is also well-suited to emerging technologies and newly developed materials about which there are many proprietary information and intellectual property concerns. SciVera gives suppliers two options: They can either provide full chemical information or for those who want to keep their cards closer to their vests they can generate and communicate to their customer (the manufacturer) a Pharos-like red yellow or green assessment result.,Less than a mile away from SciVera's operation the GreenBlue Institute has been making similar strides. James Ewell who directs the chemicals program at GreenBlue a nonprofit co-founded by William McDonough FAIA and chemist Michael Braungart has been managing the organization's CleanGredients database for preferable ingredients used in chemical-intensive products. He concludes that all of the available hazard-assessment resources available to specifiers are useful but at the end of the day environmental risk-and-benefit evaluations require weighing the results and are therefore judgment calls.,"Pharos is nice because right now it's asking useful questions about other life-cycle metrics that architects are interested in" says Ewell who also emphasizes that SciVera's flexible and scalable products could make it "the Intel Inside [program] of any company wanting to obtain in-depth toxicity information about the materials they are using.",In the event that material hazards have legal ramifications plausible deniability isn't a realistic stance. Being on top of research creates opportunities to take protective measures before regulatory compliance is needed. "If the information's out there you need to know about it-and the sooner the better" Osimitz says.,"Architects are always concerned with liability and there might be things they'd rather not know" says Columbia's Bell. But for any resource that could make plain the properties of building materials Bell adds "I would assume architects will flood to a site like that.","I've found in all the companies we've dealt with-and we have been very fortunate to deal with first-rate companies" Osimitz says "they realize that lack of knowledge does not mean lack of responsibility. And that quality data are always friendly.",architecture,material,lifecycle,leed, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjtb17kHMn1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

For years the architectural world has been struggling to keep up with the ability of pen-to-paper and the recent advents in NURB surface computer modeling algorithmic and parametric architecture. This in-return has led to the  building and technology industry playing catch-up with the recent advances in 3D architectural visualizations. In fact as computer-aided design invaded these practices in the 1980s radically transforming their generative foundations and productive capacities architecture found itself most out-of-step and least alert immersed in ideological and tautological debates and adrift in a realm of referents severed from material production.,The clear disconnect between how/what we design and the tangible manifestation of tectonic form has stalled the future of architecture. A beauty and suspense that came with the "paper architect" was the hope of one day being able to build and realize that which the mind created long before it was possible to build. One reason for this disconnect is the continued separation between building and structure another being the lack of emphasis and research with materials science and the exploration for a means to break-away from traditional building methods.,The architectural field's current use of the parametric has been superficial and skin-deep. Despite the contemporary collective desire to forget postmodern semiotic signification everything visual eventually devolves into symbolic imagery. Michael Meredith an Associate Professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Design goes as far as saying that the "parametric work" being produced today fits within an evolution of so-called postmodernism concerning the image and referent although the parametric is the tautological modulated image of quantity. To the extent the profession has utilized parametrics today there is very little instigating complexity other than a mind-numbing image of complexity falling far short of its rich potential to correlate multivalent processes or typological transformations parallel meanings complex functional requirements site-specific problems or collaborative networks.© Enrico Dini,For this reason it is refreshing and provides a new sense of hope in the future of architecture that has lead and pushed Enrico Dini an Italian inventor and Markus Kayser a young German born furniture and product designer to search out a method that combines building structure and material. Creating and setting up new methods for how architects engineers and designers can finally plan and realize the future that they have long promised.,© Enrico Dini,Enrico Dini dreamt of buildings construction and impossible shapes. He has long been inspired by Antoni Gaudi's architecture and loves the ambition with which Gaudi practiced. Dini became a civil engineer and later branched out into making machines all the while dreaming of impossible shapes. For Dini thinking about having to build with concrete and brick and the required use of scaffolding and manpower seemed outdated and inefficient. Rather than accept the constraints of the current building methods in 2004 he invented and patented a full scale 3D printing method that used epoxy to bind sand. Enrico could now 3D print buildings.,© Enrico Dini,In 2007 Enrico went back to his invention and did away with the use of the messy and sticky epoxy and got a new patent for a system using an inorganic binding material combined with sand to once more 3D print buildings. The new process had lower maintenance costs and was easier to use and cost effective. Enrico is currently working on further improving the accuracy and will 3D print a full sized roundabout sculpture in Pisa Italy. Enrico Dini calls his real scale printing machine D_Shape. As of now the D_Shape technology can easily 3D print 6m x 6m x 1m parts that could then be either shipped or assembled in place. The goal being to literally 3D print an entire building is not far off. The parts made by D_shape resemble 'sandstone.' They are comparable in strength to reinforced concrete and the ingredients are the binding material and any type of sand. D_Shape's materials cost more than regular concrete but much less manpower is needed for construction. No scaffolding needs to be constructed so overall building cost should be lower than traditional building methods.,© Enrico Dini,The system works with a rigging that is suspended over the buildable part. The system deposits the sand and then the inorganic binding ink. No water is necessary. Because the two components meet outside the nozzle the machine does not clog up and can keep up its accuracy of 25 DPI. Enrico and D_Shape are currently talking to lots of construction & engineering companies and architects about their technology. Currently Enrico has partnered with Norman Foster Architects to incorporate the us of moon dust and the building element with the ambition of one day being able to transport the 3D printing machine to the moon and build structures made of the same sand/dust found on the surface of the moon.,© Markus Kayser,Markus Kayser was born near Hannover Germany in 1983. He studied 3D Furniture and Product Design at London Metropolitan University from 2004 – 2008 and continued 2009 with the study of Product Design at the Royal College of Art and gained his Master in 2011. Markus Kayser Studio was set up in London UK in 2011. From early works of furniture and lights in his father's farm workshop through to today Markus Kayser developed an understanding of materials processes and technologies which he sees as being key in combination with the natural given. He wants to engage by producing objects that one can relate to that speak about something else other than just their utilitarian qualities. The layers to be discovered as well as one's associations with objects interest him.,Experimentation plays a central part in developing his designs. Kayser's recent work demonstrates the exploration of hybrid solutions linking technology and natural energy to show the great opportunities to question current methodologies in manufacturing and to test new scenarios of production. In his process it is important that behind the thorough research and the theory there must be a realistic proof of concept which elucidates the real potential of a given subject. He tries to tell a story and to balance the seriousness with a sense of humour. This kind of storytelling makes his products as well as his experimental works digestible without losing its depths in content.,© Markus Kayser,In August 2010 he took his first solar machine – the Sun-Cutter – to the Egyptian desert in a suitcase. This was a solar-powered semi-automated low-tech laser cutter that used the power of the sun to drive it and directly harnessed its rays through a glass ball lens to 'laser' cut 2D components using a cam-guided system. The Sun-Cutter produced components in thin plywood with an aesthetic quality that was a curious hybrid of machine-made and "nature craft" due to the crudeness of its mechanism and cutting beam optics alongside variations in solar intensity due to weather fluctuations.,© Markus Kayser,In the deserts of the world two elements dominate – sun and sand. The former offers a vast energy source of huge potential the latter an almost unlimited supply of silica in the form of quartz. The experience of working in the desert with the Sun-Cutter led him directly to the idea of a new machine that could bring together these two elements. Silicia sand when heated to melting point and allowed to cool solidifies as glass. This process of converting a powdery substance via a heating process into a solid form is known as sintering and has in recent years become a central process in design prototyping known as 3D printing or SLS (selective laser sintering).,© Markus Kayser,These 3D printers use laser technology to create very precise 3D objects from a variety of powdered plastics resins and metals – the objects being the exact physical counterparts of the computer-drawn 3D designs inputted by the designer. By using the sun's rays instead of a laser and sand instead of resins he had the basis of an entirely new solar-powered machine and production process for making glass objects that taps into the abundant supplies of sun and sand to be found in the deserts of the world.,© Markus Kayser,His first manually-operated solar-sintering machine was tested in February 2011 in the Moroccan desert with encouraging results that led to the development of the current larger and fully-automated computer driven version – the Solar-Sinter. The Solar-Sinter was completed in mid-May and later that month he took this experimental machine to the Sahara desert near Siwa Egypt for a two week testing period. The machine and the results of these first experiments presented here represent the initial significant steps towards what I envisage as a new solar-powered production tool of great potential.,© Markus Kayser,In a world increasingly concerned with questions of energy production and raw material shortages this project explores the potential of desert manufacturing where energy and material occur in abundance. In this experiment sunlight and sand are used as raw energy and material to produce glass objects using a 3D printing process that combines natural energy and material with high-tech production technology. Solar-sintering aims to raise questions about the future of manufacturing and triggers dreams of the full utilisation of the production potential of the world's most efficient energy resource – the sun. Whilst not providing definitive answers this experiment aims to provide a point of departure for fresh thinking.,© Markus Kayser,architecture,material,3d printing, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjtbjl1RnC1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515197-22-solarsiter014-528x351.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319514906-machine-dsc00011-528x351.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319514900-1-3dprintercou-528x351.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319514902-2-3dprintercou-528x373.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319514909-roundabout2-528x378.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515186-22-solarsiter013-528x297.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515236-22-solarsiter016-528x366.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515355-22-solarsiter018-528x297.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515370-22-solarsiter0110-528x351.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515398-22-solarsiter0112-528x220.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515422-22-solarsiter0114-528x365.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515202-22-solarsiter015-528x351.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1319515361-22-solarsiter019-528x352.jpg, , , , , , ,

Which is why they look to disciplines like crystallography for inspiration and guidance.,While crystallography might seem like it's pretty far removed from how to design a chair or a building it's actually informing how designers look at the products we use every day-computer chips cell phone batteries-and is as Benjamin Aranda says "driving an invention in material culture."These ideas might not be so familiar to the average person but for designers they're shaping how they think about the processes and structures that go into creating an object.,Christopher Lasch defines the companies design ethic as: "For us design is about putting in place a process from which you can guarantee surprises." Surprises that are built using algorithms and formed from fractal anatomies allowing the duo to find the endless in an object-whether that's creating a bridge from octahedrons or a crystalline stage set for Yeasayer.

But Ian Bogost asks: why stop at the unfathomability of the computer's experience when there are airports sandstone koalas climate toaster pastries kudzu the International 505 racing dinghy and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to contemplate?,From Mishka Henner's "Dutch Landscapes" series. Via new-aesthetic.tumblr.com.,You know that art has changed when a new aesthetic movement announces itself not with a manifesto but with a tumblr. Manifestos offer their grievances and demands plainly all at once on a single page-not in many hundred entries. "Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility ecstasy and slumber" wrote Filippo Marinetti in his 1909 Futurist Manifesto. "We want to exalt movements of aggression feverish sleeplessness the double march the perilous leap the slap and the blow with the fist." The stakes are clear: out with idleness and chatter in with speed and violence.,You'll find no such gripes or hopes in James Bridle's modest microblog "The New Aesthetic" which has recently enjoyed considerable attention thanks to a panel at the SXSW interactive conference a Wired essay response by Bruce Sterling and a series of responses to both at The Creators Project-not to mention dozens more replies all around the web.,Recent noise and attention notwithstanding compare Bridle's original phlegmatic blog post on the New Aesthetic to Marinetti's feverish immodesty. "We want to glorify war" the latter writes still proudly ignorant of the Great War that would turn the Dadaists against art entirely. Bridle by contrast doesn't exalt or rebuff but opens up a file folder: "For a while now I've been collecting images and things that seem to approach a new aesthetic of the future.",Here's a weird thing a computer left behind. It's a good start.,Bridle's initial collection included satellite images superimposed digital and physical maps physical goods that look like pixel art and real shoes made to look as if they were low-polygon 3D renders. His tumblr-the closest thing to an official record of New Aesthetics-offers even more curiosities. A screenshot of a Flickr search for broken Kindle e-readers. A list of tweets announcing the surprising discovery that the Titanic was a real ocean-liner and not just a film. A histogram of player moods while playing Xbox Live. A Wells Fargo ATM that laments having missed a customer's birthday.,What is the New Aesthetic? One accurate answer would be: things James Bridle posts to its tumblr. Another doubled as the subtitle for Bridle's SXSW panel and it amounts to a generalization of the same thing: "seeing like digital devices." Pixel art data visualizations computer vision sensor aids-these are the worldly residue that computers have left behind as they alter our lived experience: "Some architects can look at a building and tell you which version of autodesk was used to create it.",Marinetti discovered Futurism after driving his car into a ditch outside Milan. Avant-garde art used to work like that as exception rupture dissidence. When it wasn't formalist it was political-for better and for worse: Marinetti was an early affiliate of the Italian Fascist Party while Tristan Tzara Hugo Ball and their Dada compatriots made anti-art that rejected the nationalism and colonialism that they perceived to be the root causes of the Great War.,But today's world is one of inclusion rather than exception. The New Aesthetic doesn't have individual effects but only aggregated ones just as a technology startup can't serve a niche audience but only the largest one possible. Bridle insists that it "is not a movement." A movement draws a line in the sand but an aggregator collects seashells. Instead of drawing up dictates he pins curiosities to his digital pinboard. In a century art has evolved from caprice into bric-a-brac. The Futurists crashed cars; the New Aestheticians assemble scrapbooks.,There's an honesty to it. As Sterling writes "Look at those images objectively. Scarcely one of the real things in there would have made any sense to anyone in 1982 or even in 1992. People of those times would not have known what they were seeing with those New Aesthetic images. It's the news and it's the truth.",He's right there's something refreshingly humble about the New Aesthetics. "Here's a thing" it says as so many of us do when we email or tweet or blog or Facebook a curiosity. Here's a weird thing a computer left behind. It's a good start.,* * *,Yet to my eyes the New Aesthetic could use a dose of good old-fashioned twentieth century immodesty. Not naïve fascism or impulsive radicalism but bigger eyes larger hopes weirder goals. Sterling shares this impression: "a heap of eye-catching curiosities don't constitute a compelling worldview.",Among the Creators Project authors who responded to Sterling's essay was Greg Borenstein an artist and researcher who currently specializes in computer vision. Contra Sterling's skepticism Borenstein exudes optimism: "I believe that the New Aesthetic is actually striving towards a fundamentally new way of imagining the relations between things in the world." ,A magnifying glass holding a fork bent by a magician. Alexis Madrigal,In his essay Borenstein connects the New Aesthetics to a trend in philosophy called Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) a movement of which I myself am a part (along with Graham Harman Levi Bryant andTim Morton). If ontology is the philosophical study of existence then object-oriented ontology puts thingsat the center of being. We humans are elements but not the sole elements of philosophical interest. OOO contends that nothing has special status but that everything exists equally-plumbers cotton bonobos DVD players and sandstone for example. OOO steers a path between scientific naturalism and social relativism drawing attention to things at all scales and pondering their nature and relations with one another as much as ourselves.,My version of object-oriented ontology outlined in my new book Alien Phenomenology or What it's Like to Be a Thing concerns the experience of objects. What is it like to be a bonobo or a satellite or a pixel?,There's a reason I start from aliens instead of computers and from phenomenology instead of aesthetics. We usually understand alien either in a political or a cosmological sense: a terrestrial alien is a foreigner from another country and an extraterrestrial alien is a foreigner from another planet. Even when used philosophically to refer to otherness more generally aliennness is assumed to be a human-legible intersubjectivity. The other is someone we can recognize as enough like ourselves to warrant identification. ,But the true alien might be unrecognizable; it might not have an intelligence akin to our intelligence or even one we could recognize as intelligence. Rather than wondering if alien beings exist in the cosmos let's assume that they are all around us everywhere at all scales. Everything is an alien to everything else. It is ultimately impossible for one thing to understand the experience of another but we can speculate about the withdrawn inner experience of things based on a combination of evidence-the exhaust they leave behind-and poetics-the speculative work we do to characterize that experience.,From the vantage point of alien phenomenology I would issue several challenges to the New Aesthetic that might draw it closer to the speculative object-oriented philosophy that I advocate.,Look beyond humans and computers.,Borenstein may be right that New Aesthetic strives toward a new conception of relations between things in the world. But for now the New Aesthetic is exclusively interested in computers on the one hand and humans on the other.,In David M. Berry's words it "revels in seeing the grain of computation" the exhaust of computer activity that courses through the non-computational world. Some of these examples are created by humans like pixelated pillows. Some are created for computers like the fiducial markers that facilitate computer vision. And some are created by computers like the satellite images that let us see a familiar world in an unfamiliar way.,+cultures,*networkculture,object-oriented ontology,philosophy,tech,*ontography,+socialtech,*newaesthetic,new aesthetic, , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjv20wiqml1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:weirdforkimage_615.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:alientoasterpastry.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:toothbrush-drill.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tableaumachine_615.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Here's one that needs solving.,The invention of the smartphone has created a world where millions of people stroll through life constantly staring into a mobile device like Narcissus at the edge of a pond.,I know. I'm one of them.,People are not going to put these devices down in the near future. Realistically we will become only more absorbed by the Screen. Technology will have to solve this problem. It will do so by creating wearable computers.,Wearable computing is a broad term. Technically a fancy electronic watch is a wearable computer. But the ultimate version of this technology is a screen that would somehow augment our vision with information and media.,Over the last year Apple and Google have secretly begun working on projects that will become wearable computers. Their main goal: to sell more smartphones. (In Google's case more smartphones sold means more advertising viewed.),In Google's secret Google X labs researchers are working on peripherals that - when attached to your clothing or body - would communicate information back to an Android smartphone.,People familiar with the work in the lab say Google has hired electronic engineers from Nokia Labs Apple and engineering universities who specialize in tiny wearable computers.,Apple has also experimented with prototype products that could relay information back to the iPhone. These conceptual products could also display information on other Apple devices like an iPod which Apple is already encouraging us to wear on our wrists by selling Nanos with watch faces.,A person with knowledge of the company's plans told me that a "very small group of Apple employees" had been conceptualizing and even prototyping some wearable devices.,One idea being discussed is a curved-glass iPod that would wrap around the wrist; people could communicate with the device using Siri the company's artificial intelligence software.,The brain that brings all these things together is the smartphone which after all is really the first wearable computer. Researchers note that the smartphone is almost never more than three feet away from its user. It is often just inches from the bed during the night as well and has replaced the alarm clock for many people.,,As a result the smartphone is going to be the hub for our information sharing and gathering. Think of it as a force field that will engulf us wherever we are transmitting power and Internet access to sensors and screens that are tacked to our clothing.,,"Years ago researchers envisioned these tiny computers transmitting information to the Internet" said Yael Maguire a visiting scientist at M.I.T.and Harvard . "It wasn't what we envisioned but it happened.

Imagine teenagers being able to design their own virtual clothing that others wearing heads-up displays can see.,Parents teachers and friends could be shown entirely different outfits.

This new theme among consumers will hasten big tech companies to begin creating wearable computing products.,In a blog post on the Forrester Web site Sarah Rotman Epps the personal computer analyst who wrote the report said that wearable computing was about to move into the mainstream and the big technology companies in Silicon Valley would help hasten its adoption.,"Wearable devices or 'wearables' for short have enormous potential for uses in health and fitness navigation social networking commerce and media" Ms. Epps wrote in the blog post. "Imagine video games that happen in real space.  Or glasses that remind you of your colleague's name that you really should know. Or paying for a coffee at Starbucks with your watch instead of your phone. Wearables will transform our lives in numerous ways trivial and substantial that we are just starting to imagine.",The report says that Apple Google Microsoft Amazon and Facebook along with each company's developer communities will bring about a new platform war - not dissimilar to the mobile battles that are taking place today. The race to own this new computing space will help accelerate the creation of wearable computers.,In the report Ms. Epps outlined how each company can benefit consumers with its current war chest. "Apple has the most polished marketing channel and brand" she writes "Google has an open platform and license to dabble. Microsoft has the best depth sensor yet. Amazon has information on more than 100 million products and their buyers. Facebook has a Rolodex - and facial recognition - for 800 million people.",These companies will likely be paying attention to the lessons they have learned from the smartphone wars.,As I wrote in a Disruptions column last year wearables will likely seep into mainstream over the next five years and become commonplace over the next decade. The Forrester report predicts this could happen much faster.,Earlier this month Google finally pulled back the curtain on a secret project called Project Glass that can augment a person's vision through a computerlike pair of glasses. The glasses can stream information to the lenses and allow the wearer to send and receive messages through voice commands.

Forrester asserted that 29 percent of the global workforce now fits this description up from 23 percent in 2011.,One of the major revelations from the report is that at least interest in and demand for the Microsoft Surface is relatively high.,Despite the fact that only two percent of respondents said they are using Windows tablets for work right now approximately 32 percent replied that they would like one for their next work tablet.,Thus Forrester researchers are predicting that 200 million information workers globally will want a Windows tablet as their next work tablet.,But as smartphones go Forrester's findings reflect that this a battle between only Android and iOS at this point.,Forrester is especially optimistic for the iPhone citing that while 16 percent of information workers are using the iOS handheld for work now 33 percent said it would be their next work phone.,Forrester also offered some direct advice to chief information officers - much of which boils down to open communication with employees which can then be applied to everything from which mobile apps to install to cloud sync sharing services:,,CIOs can prioritize their device and app investments by walking a mile in employees' shoes. Build a very deep marketing understanding of who your employees are and what they use technology for.

(Its long-lasting taste supposedly brought to mind the borough's famous bridge.) Now of course you can't travel to the bottom of the South China Sea without first passing through "the Brooklyn of the Malacca Strait" or some equivalent nonsense. A preliminary list of places championed for (accused of?) "Brooklynizing" includes sections of Nashville Philadelphia San Francisco and Los Angeles and somewhat more alarmingly Paris London Stockholm and Berlin.,What could this even mean? One of the first uses of the term "Brooklynize" I dug up came from a 1920 Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce Bulletin. There to "Brooklynize" was an Orwellian euphemism for fitting young immigrant labor to stultifying factory routine. These days of course it indicates precisely the opposite: the conversion of nature into use value on the daintiest scale possible. Raw stuffs are now distilled brewed butchered jerked creamed chutneyed waffled taffied chocolatiered all by hand all within the confines of Kings County. For every Vert de Massy waiting to be brined a steampunk stands at the ready.,To the extent "Brooklyn" now designates more than a mere landmass it means: small-batch production urban husbandry period facial hair a fixed-gear bicycle "Girls." But "Brooklynizing" is different from "Brooklyn." "Brooklynizing" is the exportation of these culture-pages clichés to fresh landmasses. This would be mildly intriguing if the phenomenon were limited to say the Gulch section of Nashville (which let's face it was probably not the Bozart's fertile crescent before the first baristas arrived). But previously well-credentialed hipster enclaves are now "Brooklynizing" as well. I swear I've been hearing about the raffishly un-Californian charms of the Silver Lake neighborhood in Los Angeles for 20 years. Surely Silver Lake featured locally sourced mâche and remotely sourced Oberlin grads long before Brooklyn began rebranding every semi-employed young person in its own image.,And the phenomenon hardly stops there. Brooklyn is "the center of cool for Swedes right now" according to a recent blog post which reported on young Nordics' obsession with anything Brooklyn-branded - cycling caps beer indie rock 'n' roll you name it. In fact the 25-year-old Brooklyn Brewery plans to open its first international outpost overlooking the Stockholm harbor this year. Paris meanwhile has kept up its capacity to inspire incredulity this time by embracing anything that can be plausibly labeled "très Brooklyn" particularly food trucks. There is a Brooklyn Diner in Dubai a Brooklyn Restaurant in Malaysia and Gorky Park in Moscow features a trendy snack kiosk with the word "Williamsburg" emblazoned across its top in the Latin and not the Cyrillic alphabet.,The point being many areas currently undergoing "Brooklynization" - Canal-St. Martin in Paris the Kreuzberg section of Berlin - were teeming and weird justly magnetic urban neighborhoods already. Isn't there a simple issue of chronology here? The scrambled lineage becomes considerably less baffling once you realize that "Brooklynizing" is a state of being wholly liberated from the mundane inhibitions of space and time; a fact driven home by the observation that everything we now associate with the word "Brooklyn" actually originated 10 years earlier in Portland Ore.,It may strike you as improbable but I am not trying to be snarky ("snark" still being the only thing locally sourced in Manhattan). "Brooklynization" after all represents a serious attempt at repudiation: of Manhattan of course whose nosebleed real estate prices pushed the creative class out to Brooklyn in the first place; but also of the logic of globalization and its elevation of an international elite with no ostensible connection to either specific places or the making of physical things. If the old battle cry of youth authenticity was once Never Sell Out the new one is Never Scale Up. Here though is where the story gets a little complicated for standardization and homogenization are the gods of capitalism and they are jealous indeed.,One especially rapier critique of the phenomenon came from Justin Moyer a musician whose article in the Washington City Paper decried Brooklyn's ability to suck bands away from far-flung regional music scenes and toward Williamsburg. Moyer likes Brooklyn well enough - but as he sees it Brooklyn has created an atmosphere of creative convergence so intense so self-aware so encyclopedically pop-literate that all its resulting music begins to sound the same. When everyone speaks Brooklynish everything takes on the accent of Brooklynish.,Brooklyn is no longer the home of Luddite dignity within an urban context; it is the very idea of Luddite dignity within an urban context. Brooklyn the specific landmass is where The Local goes to be sanctified and made ready for export: to Nashville the Mission and Silver Lake; to London Paris and Berlin. It is the sound of Local going Global. Such are the wages of contemporary life I suppose.

Who owns our stuff? The answer used to be obvious. Now with electronics integrated into just about everything we buy the answer has changed.,We live in a digital age and even the physical goods we buy are complex. Copyright is impacting more people than ever before because the line between hardware and software physical and digital has blurred.,The issue goes beyond cellphone unlocking because once we buy an object - any object - we should ownit. We should be able to lift the hood unlock it modify it repair it … without asking for permission from the manufacturer.,But we really don't own our stuff anymore (at least not fully); the manufacturers do. Because modifying modern objects requires access to information: code service manuals error codes and diagnostic tools. Modern cars are part horsepower part high-powered computer.,Microwave ovens are a combination of plastic and microcode. Silicon permeates and powers almost everything we own.,This is a property rights issue and current copyright law gets it backwards turning regular people - like students researchers and small business owners - into criminals. Fortune 500 telecom manufacturer Avaya for example is known for suing service companies accusing them of violating copyright for simply using a password to log in to their phone systems. That's right: typing in a password is considered "reproducing copyrighted material.",Manufacturers have systematically used copyright in this manner over the past 20 years to limit our access to information. Technology has moved too fast for copyright laws to keep pace so corporations have been exploiting the lag to create information monopolies at our expense and for their profit. After years of extensions and so-called improvements copyright has turned Mickey Mouse into a monster who can never die.,It hasn't always been that way. Copyright laws were originally designedto protect creativity and promote innovation. But now they are doing exactly the opposite: They're being used to keep independent shops from fixing new cars. They're making it almost impossible for farmers to maintain their equipment. And as we've seen in the past few weeks they're preventing regular people from unlocking their own cellphones.,This isn't an issue that only affects the digerati; farmers are bearing the brunt as well. Kerry Adams a family farmer in Santa Maria California recently bought two transplanter machines for north of $100000 apiece. They broke down soon afterward and he had to fly a factory technician out to fix them.,Because manufacturers have copyrighted the service manuals local mechanics can't fix modern equipment. And today's equipment - packed with sensors and electronics - is too complex to repair without them. That's a problem for farmers who can't afford to pay the dealer's high maintenance fees for fickle equipment.,Adams gave up on getting his transplanters fixed; it was just too expensive to keep flying technicians out to his farm. Now the two transplanters sit idle and he can't use them to support his farm and his family.,This isn't an issue that only affects the digerati.,God may have made a farmer but copyright law doesn't let him make a living.,Neighborhood car mechanics also see copyright as a nooseconstricting their ability to fix problems. The error codes in your car? Protected. The diagnostic tools used to access them? Proprietary software.,New cars get more sophisticated every year and mechanics need access to service information to stay in business. Under the cover of copyright law auto companies have denied independent shops access to the diagnostic tools and service diagrams they need.,Fixing our cars tractors and cellphones should have nothing to do with copyright.,Mechanics aren't taking it lying down. In September of last year Massachusetts passed Right to Repair legislation designed to level the playing field between dealerships and independent repair shops. Under the rallying cry of "it's your car you should be able to repair it where you want" voters passed the bill by a whopping 86 percent margin. The law circumvents copyright requiring manufacturers to release all service information to Massachusetts car owners and service technicians. The popular unrest is spreading: Legislators in Maine just introduced similar legislation.,Meanwhile progress is being made to legalize cellphone unlocking. With grassroots groups leading the charge the Obama administration announced its support for overturning the ban last week. Since then members of Congress have authored no fewer than four bills to legalize unlocking.,This is a step in the right direction but it's not enough. Let's make one thing clear: Fixing our cars tractors and cellphones should have nothing to do with copyright.,As long as Congress focuses on just unlocking cellphones they're missing the larger point. Senators could pass a hundred unlocking bills; five years from now large companies will find some other copyright claim to limit consumer choice. To really solve the problem Congress must enact meaningful copyright reform. The potential economic benefits are significant as free information creates jobs. Service information is freely available online for many smartphones from iFixit (my organization) and other websites. Not coincidentally thousands of cellphone repair businesses have sprung up in recent years using the repair knowledge to keep broken cellphones out of landfills.,As long as we're limited in our ability to modify and repair things copyright - for all objects - will discourage creativity. It will cost us money. It will cost us jobs. And it's already costing us our freedom.,(via Forget the Cellphone Fight - We Should Be Allowed to Unlock Everything We Own | Wired Opinion | Wired.com), , , ,tech,information monopolies,copyright,socialtech,opensource, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjv9hfuU9h1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Repair is our mission at iFixit - and it always has been. Even so I didn't expect the scale of the public response when I argued last week that consumers should choose the hackable fixable non-Retina MacBook Pro over its sleeker-and-shinier-but-locked-down sibling.,The debate has been contentious. Garrett Murray argues that repairability is ludditism old-fashioned inertia dragging down forward progress. He believes that more compact devices will necessarily be less upgradeable and hackable.,Others said repair doesn't matter; consumers don't care. On some level they're right. If something breaks most computer owners won't grab a screwdriver - they'll take it to a specialist. And if the computer outlives its usefulness they won't upgrade their machine they'll just buy a faster one. Some folks correctly pointed out that Apple products are more durable than other computers. Plus Apple has a reputable extended warranty program.,But sending your difficult-to-repair computer off to a Genius doesn't exempt you from repair troubles. About a third of computers break by the fourth year. AppleCare doesn't cover accidents and only lasts up to three years. Less repairable design guarantees that fixing stuff will be more expensive and complicated. ,Repairability is important for consumers. Yet I think this argument misses the bigger point. The future of this planet depends on the quality of our electronic devices - and how long they last.,,Technology doesn't just make our lives more convenient. It makes life better on a global scale. Modern communications have driven advances in biotechnology soil science and medicine. For the first timefarmers are able to get instant weather advisories pay for fertilizer by phone while standing in the field and fight back against local monopolies with access to global commodity prices. Globally we manufactured 1.6 billion cell phones last year and we'll make over 2 billion this year. The problem? The way we're doing it hurts people and permanently damages our environment.,I dream of a sustainable technology industry that makes life-changing innovations like the iPad available to everyone on the planet. But I have a message for Jonathan Ive.,I think that on top of building amazing new products the technology industry should have three goals:,Make our innovations available to everyone on the planet not just the richest 12 percent in America and Europe.,Stop the devastating environmental and social impacts of hardware manufacturing.,Depend far less on mining than we do currently. It's not just the coltan mines fueling wars in the DRC - the Berkeley Pit disaster was so devastating that many in Montana wish they had never tapped the copper deposits. That same situation is repeating itself in parts of China and Africa right now.,I've spent a lot of time studying these problems. I've visited the electronics scrapyards in Ghana where children burn electronics to mine them for raw materials. I've interviewed product designers at leading electronics manufacturers including ones that integrate life cycle analysis into their design process. And I've spent a lot of time studying the aftermarket - the raw underbelly of the consumer electronics industry where repair reuse and material recovery happen.,There's no such thing as a completely green cell phone or computer. Even elective 'green' standards likeEPEAT are far from mandating environmentally neutral products. I'm on the EPEAT balloting committee and chemical companies have successfully lobbied for years to water down standards - much to the chagrin of everyone including many manufacturers.,I've learned that most of the environmental and social impact of the electronics industry happens outside of the purview of the device manufacturers: It happens in mines and chemical factories well upstream of Foxconn and in unregulated scrapyards around the world.,Pit mining is savaging the environment causing water pollution issues that lead to birth defects and are unbelievably expensive to clean up. Semiconductor manufacturers' insatiable demand for a vast array of minerals is also causing geopolitical issues. China is heavily restricting exports of rare earth metals to prop up its domestic manufacturing sector.,"Goodbye iBook. In your death may you give life to a dozen more computers.",When the warranty ends manufacturers would prefer it if stuff disappeared so they could sell you a new product. But the real world isn't nearly so tidy. Only a small fraction of the electronics produced are recycled. And even then they're usually shredded and separated into component materials. Shredding is a waste of resources and squanders the embodied energy in devices. Worse many materials including rare earths and coltan are not being recovered at all.,So why do we keep making more devices? We're pretty close to manufacturing almost all of the electronics we need. There's no need to make a billion more cell phones next year than we did this year. Increased manufacturing isn't just due to advances in technology - we're not very efficient at utilizing things that we already make. If you don't have at least one cell phone in your junk drawer I bet someone in your family does. That phone could be helping someone else.,In an ideal world after you've moved on to your next gadget technicians will continue to repair salvage and refurbish the old one. It will move on from owner to owner. iFixit is part of that ecosystem - in addition to teaching repair we buy computers from people and resell the components. I once received a computer with a handwritten note on it: "Goodbye iBook. In your death may you give life to a dozen more computers.",And that's my hope for electronics everywhere. Fortunately the migration of usable electronics to the developing world is natural. Lots of people can't afford to buy new computers. Passing along old devices is the best way to share the benefits of technology. In a few years the computer that you gave to Goodwill could very well end up in a computer lab in Kenya. I know electronics refurbishers that have resold the exact same computer six or seven times. And assuming repair techs have the knowledge and skill required to maintain them those computers will serve their owners well costing less each time they're passed along.,Long-lasting repairable hardware is the key to making computers available to people who couldn't otherwise afford them. Upgradeable tech also helps - even if you don't upgrade your own computer somebody else down the line can. It's amazing how long people can keep technology running.,Manufacturing electronics results in lots of nasty environmental problems everything from toxic dumping toaldehyde vapor emissions. We have decided if only by inaction that the cost of our hyper-productive modern lifestyle is worth these tradeoffs. I'm culpable myself - I live at the cutting edge along with all of you.,But if we're going to make that tradeoff the least we could do is to pass on the technology we're enjoying now. That's why I am so eager to promote hardware that lasts and call out products that don't. It's critically important that we fix things when they break. Consumers need to demand products that aren't just light and thin but can also stand the test of time. Because technology is far more than just another new gadget - it's our future.,materials,tech,material lifespan,repairability,hardware,maker culture, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjvb4iHRTn1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Today officials announced the winner of the top category "Popular Choice" and highlighted the winners of the contest's five individual categories.,While the final selection won't be implemented it will provide the city with information about what elements their community values in the pay phone's replacement structures as they begin the process of selecting official criteria for what they will ask vendors to provide.,Finding the perfect replacement is a big challenge especially with the history and technical issues to consider. The first payphone booth was installed in 1889 in Stamford Connecticut and by the 1960s there were about a million spread throughout the US including a lone booth in the Mojave Desert. At the peak of the coin-op era there were millions of phones dotting street corners and airports but they've disconnected rapidly - fewer than 500000 remain in the US. At the same time there are now more active mobile phones (327577529) in the US than people (310866000) in the US leaving many to wonder what the role of these iconic structures should be.,The Mayor's office kicked off their design challenge in January with fantastic results. "550 people registered more than 125 submissions it really was a nice response" explained Stanley Shor who as Assistant Commissioner of Franchise Administration and Planning has helped oversee the city's pay phone contract for the past twelve years. "We thought that this is a way to engage people to really start thinking about what they really want on the city streets.","As the City works to determine the overall future of the public pay telephone we're facilitating a number of pilot programs – at no taxpayer cost – which use existing payphone infrastructure to gauge public interest and feedback in the services offered" writes Nicholas Sbordone the Director of Communication & I-Gov for the NYC Dept. of Information Technology & Telecommunications. "Each of these pilot figures as part of City's strategy to garner broad-based feedback on what the public would like to see the future of the public payphone entail. We'll take the results all of the ongoing efforts above – plus the best ideas from the recently-named Reinvent Payphones Design Challenge finalists and then "bake" all of that into the City's formal solicitation (known as a Request for Proposals or "RFP") for the future of the payphone. We'll look to issue that RFP later this year.",The winning concept is called "NYFi" and was designed by Sage and Coombe Architects a 17 person boutique firm based in Manhattan that has previously designed a variety of projects for clients like Fire Department of New York and the owners of trendy lofts an Greenwich Village.,Their creation looks like a ten-foot tall double-sided iPhone down to the way the "apps" are arranged on the screen. In this concept touch screens would allow users to perform simple functions like calling a cab with the push of a virtual button.  It would also be designed to run popular apps like Yelp by leveraging increasingly powerful smartphones. The technical details of how this would work hasn't been disclosed but it's easy to imagine an Airplay-esqe experience. Physically the NYFi attempts to combine multiple pieces of street infrastructure - payphones Metro card kiosks and bus ticket dispensers - to help reduce the amount of clutter on the street and reinforce the Apple-inspired minimalist feel.,In addition to the NYFi the five other designs in this gallery brought provocative ideas to the competition and will all be considered as the city attempts to narrow down its design criteria for the final design specifications.,And for those who think the community might want to hang on to the classic steel-and-plastic setups? It appears you're in the minority.,"Besides the journalists that have a nostalgia with the pay phone most of the people I encounter are note pleased with having pay phones around" Shor says. "I've been asked by store owners 'can you get rid of that phone that is in front of my store?'",There are two models of the NYFi kiosks - A larger version for highly trafficked areas and a human scale model for residential neighborhoods.,Images: Sage and Coombe Architects,(via 10-Foot-Tall Double-Sided Touchscreen Wins NYC's Pay Phone Redesign Challenge | Wired Design | Wired.com), , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,urban interfaces,hardware,interfaces,wayfinding,pay phone,urban hardware, , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjvcf88R8N1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:nyfi-wired-design.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

See in Diablo you collect items by killing demons. In Diablo 2 trading these items involved eBay making ad hoc games to barter( and try not to get cheated) or brokering deals in chat rooms and lobbies. Diablo 3 "solves" this inconvenience by supplying an auction house where players can auction/sell their items. It's much more efficient. Everyone should like it right?,They don't. In fact the forums are full of people complaining about it. Complaining that some je ne sais quoi was lost from Diablo 2. It's not really less social it's just too produced. But of course it is it's one of the biggest game franchises of all time. It's always been overproduced. So what is missing?,Bricolage.,Jane Feuer writes "Claude Levi-Strauus has used the term bricolage to describe the cognitive processes of 'folk' culture cultures which are prescientific. For Levi-Strauss primitive thought is a kind of intellectual bricolage. In creating their cultural and intellectual artifacts primitive people make use of materials-at-hand which may or may not bear any relation to the intended project but which appear to be all they have to work with.",Diablo 3 is missing that improvisation that takes an over-engineered product and makes it seem like a product of the people. It gives too much. It fails at allowing its community to create folk token economies by giving them a formal auction house. It doesn't let them erase the mechanical roots of the product with their ad hoc use of game features other than they were intended. (Of course at some level the game engineers built into the game these avenues for invention these freedoms.),How does this all work?,The Musical,In the Jane Feuer essay quoted above Mass Art as Folk Art Feuer describes the process by which. "ideology acts to make the cultural seem natural to mask the transforming material forces of history … Ideology operates in the musical to make mass entertainment (a product of capitalism) appear entertainment (a product of pre-industrial societies)." By making their musicals seems folkier Hollywood erased their over-production. Hollywood countered the alienating effects of their big budget products.,This was accomplished by "valorizing" the community product the spontaneous performance the amateur. "…human values and relations associated with folk art are substituted for the economic values and relations associated with mass-produced art. Through this system of exchange the economic relations are erased as the human realtions are created.",The tactics for this were:,Bricolage overcoming engineering: Dancing with brooms and lightposts erases the expensive sets and prop budgets by making it seem like Gene Kelley and Fred Astaire are just "making do" with what's at-hand.,Non-choreography masks actual choreography and professional talent: By horsing around dancing in groups stomping on garbage can lids professional dancers seem like they are just having fun not performing scripted numbers.,The rehearsal as performance: We don't see our stars on stage just getting ready or singing with a coach a teacher. The rehearsal though is the performance: think Glee.,The amateur: Our stars are farm girls nobodies sailors. Playing the role of not-singers not-dancers they pretend to not be professionals.,The spontaneous song: Oh this wasn't rehearsed we all just happened to be sitting here and now we are singing and dancing together.,Together these methods "naturalize the relationship between mass art and its audience as one of community rather than alienation.,I was happy here. But I work in journalism. As I was rereading "Mass Art as Folk Art" I realized that Hollywood musicals were diagnosing and responding to many of the same ills that journalism suffers from now the difficulties of a more austere public that's less trustful of/ receptive to big production companies.,Folk journalism,We keep hearing that community journalism will cure the problems in journalism. The problem as everyone knows is that 'hyperlocal' journalism is generally not very engaging. There are exceptions sure. But it is very difficult to maintain interest reporting on a small group of people that are more "folks having fairs" than "politicians having affairs". There is tremendous value in tightly focused local journalism. It just doesn't scale well. So why do we keep talking about it?,See big journalism is alienating. Even though the industry isn't printing money like it used to - hemorrhaging it really - journalism is still very produced and engineered. No matter how many stories we do about local artisans and urban farms (which I'm not bashing) we are still big companies mired in profits CEOs products etc. There is something necessarily alienating about publicly traded big business newspapers. That's why growing up I was teased for reading The New York Times at my local rural diner.,It's not because big newspapers don't do great local journalism gritty profiles and fantastic community pieces (and we do). It's because the economic machinery and the technological polish around these productions taint the authenticity foul the bed.,Can we learn from musicals?,authenticity,bricolage,folk media,cultures,primitivism,video games,network culture,new aesthetic, , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjvcwgYn071s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:randomFilename_207329190568998,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:randomFilename_209436843637377, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

CNET gets ahead of the curve with Corning's future tech for smartphones and more.,,,,LAS VEGAS-There's no question that flexible screens are the future along with the bendable products that go with them. Corning maker of Gorilla Glass 3 was kind enough to drop by our CNET booth at CES to show me Willow Glass its take on bendable glass so thin you can curve it in a deep arc without breaking.,,Willow Glass is as thick as a business card - only 0.1 millimeter thick - and as malleable as promised. I could easily bend it within its plastic laminate cover but at this early stage in development I wasn't able to handle the bare glass.,Manufacturers who use the glass in future products will be able to spool the material and bend it around displays like smartphones for example.,Samsung's awesome flexible display tech,Corning Gorilla Glass 3 means more scratch-proof screens,Flexy iPhone on the way? Apple patents one method,The glass can also conform to curves making it ideal for rounded and circular structures like the wavy walls of CNET's CES booth. In addition to forming an interior or base material for products - called the substrate - it can also protect sensitive electronic parts from moisture. Think of the photovoltaic cells used in solar paneling. Now imagine solar roofing you can carry onto a roof in a roll and unfurl all at once rather than apply tile by tile.,In the tech world Corning is synonymous with its chemically strengthened Gorilla Glass products that cover smartphones tablets and laptops. This flexible Willow Glass is a different beast meant for its lightness and razor-thin profile not for durability and protection.,,This is the glass of your future device.,,Though extremely flexible Willow Glass can break if bent too deeply. This is an important reminder for followers of the flexi-screen craze. Corning will focus on increasing the ultraslim glass' reliability and strength but don't expect Willow to become as strong as Gorilla. "It's just the physics of it" said Dr. Dipak Chowdhury a Corning division vice president and Willow director.,Announced last June Corning expects to mass produce Willow Glass in the second half of 2013 with commercial products entering the market in early 2014.,(via Hands-on with Corning's bendable Willow Glass (exclusive) | CES 2013: Smartphones - CNET Blogs), , , , , ,materials,glass,hardware,interfaces,wearables,tech, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjveqiKTTr1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:CorningWillowGlass_DeepBend_220x157.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:CorningWillowGlass_bizcard_220x157.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:CorningWillowGlass_SlightBend_220x157.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But for people looking at the people wearing those glasses the view is even stranger - someone wearing a computer processor a battery and a tiny screen on her face.,As Google and other companies begin to build wearable technology like glasses and watches an industry not known for its fashion sense is facing a new challenge - how to be stylish. Design has always been important to technology with products like Apple's becoming fashion statements but designing hardware that people will wear like jewelry is an entirely different task.,In a sign of how acute the challenge is for Google the company is negotiating with Warby Parker an e-commerce start-up company that sells trendy eyeglasses to help it design more fashionable frames according to two people briefed on the negotiations who were not authorized to speak publicly because the partnership has not been made official.,Google and Warby Parker declined to comment.,They join other companies that are grappling with these design challenges including big companies like Apple Nike and Jawbone and smaller ones like Pebble MetaWatch and Misfit Wearables.,Jawbone's health-tracking wristband Up for instance was designed by Yves Behar the company's chief creative officer and a well-known designer who has worked with fashion and furniture companies. Apple which is said to be makinga smart watch has assigned some of its top designers to make curved glass that is comfortable and aesthetically appealing.,On Wednesday Google began accepting applications to choose a small group of people to buy an early version of the glasses called Google Glass. It hopes to sell Glass to the broader public this year according to two people briefed on the plans.,The frames do not have lenses though Google is experimenting with adding sunglass or prescription lenses in some versions. They have a tiny screen that appears much bigger from the wearer's perspective than it does on the frame. Glass wearers can take pictures or record video without using their hands send the images to friends or post them online see walking directions search the Web by voice command and view language translations.,The glasses reach the Internet through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth which connects to the wireless service on a user's cellphone. The glasses respond when a user speaks touches the frame or moves the head.,For Google the glasses are a major step toward its dream of what is known as ubiquitous computing - the idea that computers and the Internet will be accessible anywhere and we can ask them to do things without lifting a finger.,The glasses will eventually incorporate several Google products which could become more useful when they are in front of a user's eyes rather than on a phone or a computer screen.,For instance the latest version of the glasses can provide walking and hiking directions from Google Maps alerts from Google Now about a coming meeting or a traffic jam and video chats from Google Hangouts.,In a video released on Wednesday Google offered ideas about what to do with the glasses. A ballerina could record and stream live video behind the scenes and onstage; a tourist in Thailand could ask Google to translate the word "delicious" while eating noodles on a boat; or a family could video chat over a long distance with a relative on her birthday.,Other seemingly far-fetched uses are not far off. The glasses could be used to play an augmented reality game in which the real world was annotated with virtual information. Google has such a smartphone app called Ingress. Users could photograph an object or building and the glasses could identify it something that is already possible using Google on phones and computers.,Though Google warns of technical bumps as people use the glasses it has already solved many of the technical challenges. The biggest obstacle now is getting people to use them.,Though Google employees have been spotted wearing them in the San Francisco Bay Area they receive strange looks for example from a bartender who made fun of his Glass-wearing patrons.,Privacy advocates worry about a day when people wearing glasses could use facial recognition to identify strangers on the street or surreptitiously record and broadcast conversations. On a more mundane level rude behavior like checking e-mail during conversations would become much easier to hide.,"Changing behavior is much more challenging than changing technology" said Olof Schybergson founder and chief executive of Fjord a design company that has helped clients build wearable devices.,Then there is that fashion hurdle. The frames now look like wire wraparound glasses with hardware along one side.,"If you look at other wearable pieces of functional technology there's a reason they're not ubiquitous. There's a reason we all make fun of someone wearing a Bluetooth or a BlackBerry holster" said Daniella Yacobovsky co-founder of BaubleBar an online jewelry retailer. "Is it useful? Of course it is. Do I look like a tool? Yeah. I'm not going to wear it.",Google's design team has made Glass's look and comfort a priority according to a person briefed on the company's design process.,Designers first made it in black thinking it would flatter everyone but they added colors because black frames can look heavy on a fair person. The glasses which 18 months ago weighed eight pounds are now lighter than a typical pair of sunglasses. Engineers have worked to shrink the components so wearers look less like cyborgs.,In addition to considering partnering with Warby Parker Google is doing other things to recruit the fashion-savvy particularly women. It could open retail stores where people can try on the glasses according to news reports. At Fashion Week last year models wore colored versions on the runway for Diane von Furstenberg and the designer made abehind-the-scenes video wearing the glasses.,Google is showing women wearing the glasses in many of its public relations photos.

"The key to the future is how can you make such conversations socially even more normal?",Mr. Singhal is talking about what computer scientists call ubiquitous computing or intelligence augmentation - the idea that computers will no longer be devices we turn on but will be so integrated into our everyday environment that we can ask them to do things without ever lifting a finger.,"It's not just a question of having screens everywhere or wearing a screen but also this whole idea of phones and devices becoming more context-aware so they can offer information that is highly relevant" said Pattie Maes founder and director of the M.I.T. Media Lab fluid interfaces group which studies how to integrate digital information into daily life.,If people are discussing the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies over dinner for instance phones will be able to hear that and present a map she said. Or when you meet someone your glasses could show you the person's LinkedIn profile and your last e-mail exchange.,"It's the integration of the digital and physical worlds so no longer are they two relatively separate spheres where you have to make the connection between them" Ms. Maes said.,Many tech companies are trying to integrate the two worlds. In Apple's new iPhone Siri the voice-activated assistant can answer questions about current movies sports and restaurants.,Microsoft is experimenting with computers that understand gestures and voice like gloves with sensors Bing voice search on the Xbox and gesture recognition on the Kinect. I.B.M. is teaching machines to learn and interact with people including in hospitals. But Google is at the forefront with vast research about what kinds of questions people want answered - and when.,Google says its internal logs reveal that mobile searches spike during mealtimes when people are away from their computers but still want information immediately. And people ask more questions about trivia - "How tall is the Statue of Liberty" (answer: 305 feet) and "How old is the earth" (4.54 billion years) - on mobile devices than on computers.,To make these searches easier last month Google introduced mobile search apps for Android phones and iPhones that let people ask questions aloud and listen to Google answer in a vaguely robotic woman's voice.,The idea is that people do not have to excuse themselves from conversation to type a query and everyone can hear the answer as if Google were another guest.,In May Google introduced fact cards to answer trivia-type queries; these are answers on the search results page so people do not have to click on a link wait for a Web page to load and further delay the conversation. Say you urgently need to know Ryan Gosling's net worth. Search on your phone and above the links to search results Google tells you. (It is $50 million.),Google Glass eyeglass frames that let people use the Web on a tiny screen near their temples are not yet for sale but will let people find answers without reaching into their pockets. So will other wearable computers that Google plans to experiment with like watches.,The company is also studying screens that could be built into kitchen walls or dining room tables to make Google a constant companion that everyone in the room could talk to.,"If we take it to the next step which we're excited about Google and the information I need is right here in the room with me" said Scott Huffman the engineering director in charge of mobile search at Google. "As we're talking we just say 'Hey Google blah blah blah' and it comes up on a screen or tells you the answer.",That does not excite everyone. "It sounds like a horrible dystopian nightmare" said Helena Echlin who wrote the Table Manners etiquette column at Chow the food site.,Still Ms. Echlin says she may change her tune when everyone is wearing computers on their faces. Five years ago after all she wrote that no one should ever use a cellphone at mealtime. Now she said "you'd have to be a complete Luddite to ban a phone from the dinner table.",Phil Maslow 27 who works for a pharmaceutical start-up in New York has no problem relying on Google at his fingertips no matter the setting.,"It's a substitute for a good memory" he said.

You're basically paralyzed with choice plus we've all been in a situation where you put on a song only to realize it wasn't really what you wanted then had to skip through looking for something else. Life is hard.,Japanese company Neurowear-who came up with those wearable cat ears and cat tail that are controlled by your brain-have created a set of headphones that will determine your mood and find the right songs to fit it. They're called Mico headphones and they use a brain sensor to determine whether you want to rock out to a bit of Motörhead or keep it real with some Justin Bieber.,The headphones work in collaboration with an app which calibrates your brainwave via an EEG sensor that's attached to the headphones. By reading your brain patterns it can determine your mood and then a song is selected and played from the Neurowear database that the software thinks will compliment your mood. That way you can free up your brain to make more important decisions like what to get for lunch.,You can check out the demo video above and the instruction video below.,[via Gizmag],http://bit.ly/ZUXGII, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,design,tech,emotion,socialtech,anticipatorycomputing, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjv3cl68ln1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Or Looking for the Women on Wikipedia,,By Claire Potter,To celebrate women's history month I have decided to tweet an historical fact about a woman or women every day in March. Silly? Perhaps. Fun? Why yes: I'm enjoying it enormously. Women's history rocks.,So far women as different as abolitionist Harriet Tubman the Empress Josephine Bonaparte and Svetlana Alliluyeva have appeared in the Twitter feed to the right of this post. I find these women by simply entering the date in Wikipedia's search box: a list of events births and deaths show up in an entry devoted to that day. Presto!,Well not so fast.,You might be surprised to learn how very few items in these lists name women as historically significant figures.  Sometimes there are three or four women named; sometimes it is only one.  One day there were absolutely no women listed and I had to get creative: I picked a major civil rights event and did some newspaper research to discover a woman who was at the scene. I figured that out of 600 people marching to Selma one had to be a woman even though all the leaders photographed were men. You wouldn't think it would be difficult to name a woman who was at the scene during a historical riot or at a moment in a revolution but you would be wrong. Most accounts of major historical events that I have looked up in Wikipedia also include no women as actors.,So what's up with this sausage party as blogpal Historiann would call it?,,It is no secret that Wikipedians are mostly male.  Two years ago Noem Cohen pointed to the fact that according to the Wikimedia Foundation's own study only 13 percent of contributors to the site were female (New York Times January 31 2011). "Sue Gardner the executive director of the foundation" Cohen wrote "has set a goal to raise the share of female contributors to 25 percent by 2015 but she is running up against the traditions of the computer world and an obsessive fact-loving realm that is dominated by men and some say uncomfortable for women." A little over a year later the foundation came out with new numbers: after this big push from the top only one out of ten Wikipedians was a woman.,,I find it a slightly dubious assumption that Wikipedia's poor showing in the gender department simply reflects a computer world that is hostile to women. While gaming is notoriously misogynistic both in its content and in its playing practices other aspects of the computer world are not. Female journalists seem to take to the Interwebz as easily as their male colleagues. Female users of Facebook overtook male users in 2009 and in 2012 the typical Twitter user was a woman with an iPhone. Women have defined whole realms of the blogosphere most prominently mommy blogging and food blogging. In my own field  digital humanities and digital history projects tends to employ roughly equal numbers of women and men (see the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media for example) and women were in on the ground floor at H-Net.,So what explains this bizarre imbalance on Wikipedia? Sarah Stierch 2012 Wikipedian in residence at the Smithsonian seemed to think that the kinds of men who are motivated to write and edit articles want to maintain a traditional intellectual hierarchy that positions white men firmly at the center of world history. In "How Many Women Does It Take To Change Wikipedia?" (Smithsonian.com April 4 2012) Stierch argued that the consensus view among male Wikipedians reflects a vestigial consensus within the historical profession itself: that the proper status of women in history is to paraphrase Stokely Carmichael prone.,One of the biggest complaints we get is that women who are involved in science don't always have a great chance of having their articles saved on Wikipedia because people don't think they're notable enough" Stierch says. "But if you're in the Smithsonian Archives you're notable. And I'm so happy that the Archives wants to work with us to document that.,Here's a wild fact. At a Women in Science edit-a-thon at the Smithsonian led by Stierch new articles about women scientists were nominated for deletion even as they were being posted.,However as Joe Hill and his girlfriend Hilda Erickson used to say: "Don't get mad. Organize!" I would like to suggest that at every history conference in the foreseeable future there should be a women's history Wikipedia Room open to women and men to change the state of play in this important online resource. Furthermore each of us teaching women's history should organize students next March to not only post new articles about women but correct existing articles to reflect the presence of women at major historical events.,Are you with me?,Update: Adeline Koh shares details of a virtual event organized by The Crunk Feminist Collective here. (HT),This entry was posted in All The News That Fits Annals of Contemporary HistoryHistorians Unite its always women's history month.

Digital dualists believe that the digital world is "virtual" and the physical world "real." This bias motivates many of the critiques of sites like Facebook and the rest of the social web andI fundamentally think this digital dualism is a fallacy. Instead I want to argue that the digital and physical are increasingly meshed and want to call this opposite perspective that implodes atoms and bits rather than holding them conceptually separate augmented reality.,In a 2009 post titled "Towards Theorizing An Augmented Reality" I discussed geo-tagging (think Foursquare or Facebook Places) street view face recognition the Wii controller and the fact that sites like Facebook both impact and are impacted by the physical world to argue that "digital and material realities dialectically co-construct each other." This is opposed to the notion that the Internet is like the Matrix where there is a "real" (Zion) that you leave when you enter the virtual space (the Matrix) -an outdated perspective as Facebook is increasingly real and our physical world increasingly digital.,I have used this perspective of augmentation to critque dualism when I see it. For instance last year I posted a rebuttal to the digital-dualist critique of so-called "slacktivism" that claimed "real" activism is being traded for a cyber-based slacker activism. No cyber-activism should be seen in context with physical world activism and how they interact. Taken alone yes much of the cyber-activism would not amount to much. But used in conjunction with offline efforts it can be powerful. And of course my point is much much easier to make with the subsequent uprisings in the Arab world that utilize both digital and physical organizing. This augmented dissent will be a topic for another post.,Recently I have critiqued "cyborg anthropologist" Amber Case for her use of Turkle's outdated term "second self" to describe our online presence. My critique was that conceptually splitting so-called "first" and "second" selves creates a "false binary" because "people are enmeshing their physical and digital selves to the point where the distinction is becoming increasingly irrelevant." [I'll offer my own take for what that digital presence should be called in a soon-to-come post.],But the dualism keeps rolling in. There are the popular books that typically critique social media from the digital dualist perspective. Besides Turkle's Alone Together there is Carr's The Shallows Morozov's The Net Delusion Bauerlein's The Dumbest Generation Keen's The Cult of the AmateurSiegel's Against the Machine Lanier's You Are Not a Gadget and the list goes on (we can even include the implicit argument in the 2010 blockbuster movie The Social Network). All of these argue that the problem with social media is that people are trading the rich physical and real nature of face-to face contact for the digital virtual and trivial quality of Facebook. The critique stems from the systematic bias to see the digital and physical as separate; often as a zero-sum tradeoff where time and energy spent on one subtracts from the other. This is digital dualism par excellence. And it is a fallacy.,I am proposing an alternative view that states that our reality is both technological and organic both digital and physical all at once. We are not crossing in and out of separate digital and physical realities ala The Matrix but instead live in one reality one that is augmented by atoms and bits. And our selves are not separated across these two spheres as some dualistic "first" and "second" self but is instead an augmented self. A Haraway-like cyborg self comprised of a physical body as well as our digital Profile acting in constant dialogue. Our Facebook profiles reflect who we know and what we do offline and our offline lives are impacted by what happens on Facebook (e.g. how we might change our behaviors in order to create a more ideal documentation).,Most importantly research demonstrates what social media users already know: we are not trading one reality for another at all but instead using sites like Facebook and others actually increase offline interaction. This is not zero-sum dualism. As the famous Network Societytheorist Manuel Castells stated earlier this month,Nobody who is on social networks everyday (and this is true for some 700 million of the 1200 million social network users) is still the same person. It's an online/offline interaction not an esoteric virtual world.,None of this is to say that social media and the web should not be critiqued. Indeed it should be and I hope to do that work myself. However critiques of social media should begin with the idea of augmented reality. Is a reality augmented by digitality a good thing? My job with this post is not to answer that question but to help make it possible.,(via Digital Dualism versus Augmented Reality  Cyborgology), , , , , , , , , , , , , ,socialtech,behavior,society,network culture,digital dualism,tech, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjvhxqylqo1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:google-map-marker-google-io-20091.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It's a cultural exchange that will help both countries further understand each other's artistic heritage from the European influence on American art to how Korean art shifted from Confucianism ideals to more realistic representation.,Skip forward 100 odd years from the end of the Chosun period and you have a new crop of Korean artists who are making their mark in the world and living and working in America. One of these is New York-based Jin-Yo Mok who uses technology to engage his audience in a more direct and immediate way so they're free of the need to know an art history degree's worth of info about the artist to appreciate the work. "For me the most important moment is when someone walks into somewhere like a gallery and meets an art piece. There and then at that very moment the value of the piece is determined and the message is delivered" he says in the video above.,,His works have included sound installations like Sonic Column an LED column that lights up and plays music as you touch it and E-MAN an online entity that became an offline interactive sculpture. He's also made large scale works-like Noble Mono (above) a layered 10000 LED facade for a Seoul department store-that reflects his approach of engaging audiences through playful simple ways using technology as a facilitator. "The design aspects of artworks sometimes start from technology." he explains. "And from new technologies new ideas blossom. From that sometimes a new form appears also. The search for beauty within that then becomes art.",Last year he made headlines with Hyper-Matrix created by his new media art group Jonpasang. This "kinetic landscape" was made for the Hyundai Motor Group Exhibition Pavilion and used a huge grid of computerized pistons to animate a wall of Styrofoam blocks. It was a feat of precise engineering and jaw-dropping spectacle as the cubes shift into various patterns in a fluid hypnotizing motion (just listen to the gasps of the crowds in the vids below).,"I want technology to become more simplified so we can understand better" he says.

Do they democratize the work or merely make it an advertisement for itself? ,Last August in the midst of controversy over populist exhibitions at MOCA in Los Angeles museum director Jeffrey Deitch described a new sort of art audience: "They're not the people who make a living as artists art critics or professional art collectors … These are people who hear about a great new film they want to go to. They hear that there's a terrific new fashion store that's very cool - they want to go there. They don't differentiate between these cultural forms." It follows that the blockbuster-exhibit-obsessed art world - like its not-so-distant cousin Hollywood - must now compete with the onslaught of other entertainment forms and devices for the limited attention of such viewers.,Netflix YouTube Vimeo Gawker tablets and mobile phones have all contributed to our daily retinal traffic jam as art historian David Joselit argues in the waning pages of After Art. This he argues has forced geriatric museums to pop the institutional equivalent of Cialis and erect larger more elaborate architectural additions to draw globe-trotting tourists into newly deindustrialized cities.,Absent from Joselit's lament though is the fact that many artists thrive within these media forms that are believed to threaten traditional exhibition spaces.,,Contrary to oft-heard accounts of balkanization and walled gardens present in social networks several recent art projects have exceeded the bounds of their original context gaining a large non-art-related audience en route to online virality. These audiences share images and videos initially conceived as artworks without any concern for authorship context or property - without any particular awareness that they are engaging with "art" at all. That is they are art audiences by accident.,What becomes of art when the majority of those interacting with it don't recognize it as such? What happens "after art"?,,To examine the accidental audience in action I will be focusing on Jogging - a blog I founded with Lauren Christiansen and presently contribute to along with hundreds of others - because I have been able to track how a wide range of viewers have interacted with work posted there.,De-Authorship Decontextualization and Art as Property,Jogging began as a Tumblr in 2009 that displayed Google Image Searched products Photoshopped together as artworks with the same text you'd find on any museum wall placard: title date medium and author. Discrepancies would arise between the visual content and the descriptions as digital collages were variously titled as installations paintings or sculptures raising questions about the leveling effects of installation photography on all mediums and the power that documentary images have over the physical objects they depict. The site garnered a small amount of attention in its first two years and then after a hiatus its popularity grew exponentially with the inclusion of a dozen new members and a significantly increased posting schedule over the summer of 2012. As the project's popularity increased the work featured on it became increasingly paradoxically dissociated from the names of those who created it.,It's fair to say Jogging faced this predicament because of Tumblr the largest image-aggregating social network on the Internet comprising 50 million blogs with 20 billion images last year alone. Every Tumblr post openly tracks its number of notes - the total of likes and reblogs a post receives. Among Tumblr users reblogs - an automated form of appropriation that takes media from one blog and inserts it on your own - are the preferred note currency because they exponentially increase a post's visibility and the likelihood it will be further circulated. When users reblog content in Tumblr the service publicly keeps track of where posts originated and who has since liked or reblogged those posts.,,Reblogs are simultaneously a form of viewership and a mode of display: they acknowledge a user's past interest as audience while offering content to future audiences. Reblogging thus has similarities to what sociologists call prosumption the act of consuming and producing at the same time. For some prosumption constitutes part of their artistic practice though most typify this relationship with content as a way of curating.,,,,On a social network flush with recycled posts there's a premium on delivering original content for others to share.,,Attention-hungry users gain prestige by  being seen as the origin point of a highly sharable image. It isn't as impressive if a post has 10000 notes and you're the 10001st person to reblog it. This creates an incentive for users to drag popular images to their desktop and fraudulently repost them on Tumblr as though they had created or found the image independently. It's not a lie about creation but a lie about curation ("Look what I found" not "Look what I made") to put one's taste and image-hunting abilities in the best possible light - to make them seem original.,By manually reposting and opting out of Tumblr's provenance interface users essentially cut off the author's signature from a work. Such fraudulent reposting is as commonplace as it is despised though it would seem the theft of authorship or curatorial taste is the logical conclusion of a social network premised on the appropriation of content. The majority of Tumblr's viewership occurs through its Dashboard where notes are always made visible but notes and backlinks can be obscured by skins that prohibit visitors from viewing the number of notes of any given post on a user's Tumblr homepage.,,These omissions and obfuscations of authorship create an increased likelihood that art images will be stripped of their status as art allowing audiences to understand the work as something other than art. They become accidental art audiences.,tech,art,cultures,new aesthetic,tumblr,audience,artists,network culture,image fundamentalism,image neoliberalism,joselit,authenticity,image anarchism, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjwwpqh6Hk1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:cindy-383x282.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:paradise-383x437.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:har-straighet-383x318.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:hair-straight-2-383x287.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:my-kid-could-do-that.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The strip of highway along California's Interstate 5 was inundated with motorists traveling up and down California's middle land between the state's two most bustling hubs – the San Francisco Bay Area and the Los Angeles area – as people are wont to do the Saturday after Thanksgiving.,The San Joaquin Valley is prime farmland for raising crops and cattle – a fact easily learned by the nostrils once you enter Coalinga a city along the highway. But that year because of draught conditions many farmers didn't plant their fields so dry dirt began to build up along the interstate. As 40-mile-per-hour winds gusted a dust storm blinded motorists. The result was a 104-car pileup with 17 people dead and 150 seriously injured.,The aftermath was Hollywood apocalyptic: Burning cars and smashed trucks smoldering through a filter of dust while survivors climbed out of cars bloody and caked with dirt.,The promise is that twenty years from now mass adoption of self-driving cars might have prevented a tragedy like this. Optimists say if we're lucky we may be seeing these cars on the roadas soon as next decade. But we'll need some big jumps up in technology for the vision to be as good as futurists hope. As things are now even if we all had a self-driving car they probably wouldn't have done a thing to prevent the horrendous pileup on I-5 one of the worst in the country's recent history. Lidar technology – integral to the self-driving car's very functionality essentially serving as the car's eyes – is right now too vulnerable to the forces of nature: snow dust even glaring sunlight.,Scientists are working to better that technology and bring us into the driverless and hopefully motor fatality-free future. That's not insignificant: There were over 32000 traffic deaths in the United States in 2011 and that's the lowest count in over 60 years. There are two big developments in cars that the average consumer - and reporters like me - are dying to see even if they seem too good to be possible: Sleeping in the driver's seat and not crashing.,When a promise like that is dangled in front of you for the not-to-terribly-distant future it's hard to get excited about the kind of news and developments we're getting in the meantime. Every other day we hear another announcement about some piece of technology integrating with cars: social networks integrating with cars voice activated music controls and the like.,But the self-driving car is such a seminal science-fictionesque milestone that mere mortal software integrations seem boring by comparison. It all feels comparatively lackluster.,Don't get me wrong. This isn't a rant about how boring technology has become. Instead I wonder if the narrative around self-driving cars actually hurts companies trying to develop car solutions now. Most new products have a brief honeymoon period where they can bask in mystique and novelty. But the promise of a self-driving car squashes that because well what's more novel than a self-driving car?,It may be a while before the self-driving car is mainstream but mainstream coverage is clearly already here. In addition to PandoDaily the cars have been highlighted in a major story inFortune Magazine the New York Times the Guardian and several other outlets. These publications regularly write about cool out-there scientific things but there's something different about this coverage. For example a story isn't about how the technology simply exists but that California is the latest state to legalize testing. ,These aren't futurists spouting on about the horizon. There is no hypothetical air to the tone of these self-driving car stories. The story is: It's happening.,While the gloss of the self-driving car narrative isn't helping the companies trying to innovate in the space now the current state of the in-car experience isn't very good either. Nest CEO Tony Fadell once told me that in-car electronics are "abysmal" and that the car needs to have a better relationship with the smart phone. Yes Peyton Manning can tell his dashboard to call his dad and Blake Griffin can tell the UVO in his Kia Optima to play "This is How We Do it" but that technology has been around a while.,There's not much today that breaks the mold.,Companies certainly are trying. Just yesterday Life360 a mobile network for families announced a partnership with BMW that will allow the company to integrate some of its services into cars' dashboards. Life360 aims to keep families connected and safe with features like allowing a child to check in with his or her parents or pushing crime alerts. The car integration will let a user tap on a family member's avatar on a dashboard and automatically route the car to that person. (It also finds a parking spot next to him or her.),And earlier this week the navigation company TomTom announced that it would bake its mapping software into the Uconnect Radio Nav system in Fiats and that it would power onboard traffic blotters for Toyota and Mercedes-Benz. Siri Eyes Free the auto-ready version of Apple's virtual assistant pops into the news every now and again to announce a new car manufacturing partner.,These things are all cool but they serve as constant reminders that they are essentially placeholders. For example the Life360 integration is actually very helpful but how much cooler would it be if the car actually drove itself to that person and parked on its own? The beauty of putting Siri in a car is that voice commands mean fewer distractions while driving. But with a car that drives itself that use case fizzles away.,There are some things to get excited about. BMW Audi and Ford have all unveiled self-parallel parking assistants. Other manufacturers will soon have cars with options that use sensors to keep you from straying from your lane. Tesla along with its dashboard API is promising even though it has a limitations for now – regardless of any New York Times reporting controversy.,I'm hard-pressed to think of another time this something-better-comes-along phenomenon has occurred in this way. Nobody thumbed their noses at VHS because they knew DVDs would appear decades later. There was however a land-grab attempt by Sony's Betamax though tech lore says the porn industry decided that battle. Laserdisc never took off not because of the looming threat of DVDs but because it was an expensive terrible format. People only started adopting the iPod after realizing how much better it was than any other MP3 player and not the other way around.,The only analogy that bears any type of resemblance – though on a vastly smaller scale – would be a customer deciding against buying the current model of a phone because she is holding out for the next model or decades ago holding out for a computer with more processing power. But that's usually about incremental improvement.,The anticipation in the kind of step function in auto experience we're talking about is something we haven't seen before. It's only been recently because of Moore's Law and the rapid clip at which tech advances that we can have an accurate enough crystal ball to foresee with some degree of accuracy when these major milestones will take place.,But to get there we need to support the present. Mass adoption of self-driving cars are many many years off and it's not like we can stop innovating in the meantime.,These companies - like Life360 or even Apple - needed to enter the connected car space at some point and what better time is now? They will be the ones retooling our concept of the interior of a vehicle. And the more they are rewarded in hype press and sales– the more the market will become appealing to capitalists and innovators.,Of course the mind will always wonder. Self-driving cars aren't even here yet and already I'm wondering about flying cars – though we've been doing that in pop culture since the 1960s. Space travel is already getting more serious treatment from the press thanks largely to SpaceX.,I asked Shasta Ventures partner Rob Coneybeer who had looked into backing self-driving cars about flying cars. He let out a hefty laugh. While he's bullish on the self-driving car he doesn't think we'll have a flying car in our lifetime citing the physics of it being too difficult right now.,Perhaps Elon Musk will have something to say about that.,(via All of these connected car integrations just make me more impatient for a self-driving car),car,tech,self-driving,communication, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjwws9zjuh1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

She asked about my presentation and we got talking about Self Quantification and Identity.  This particular friend is also an occasional running partner and a fellow nutrition enthusiast. We seamlessly moved into her personal tracking habits and she shared with me that when she uses her calorie tracking app she ends up omitting a good deal of information and contextualizing other data. Specifically she tells me that she "forgets" to track her food while spending weekends with her long-distance boyfriend (during which she tends to eat more) and made a point to write down that it was her birthday to explain why she was so high above her daily allotment one day last month. Interestingly she does not have any followers on this app which means her justifications and omissions are purely for own benefit. She is not keeping up appearances for others but rather maintaining meanings for herself.,My friend's experiences resonated with a hovering notion that has lingered with me since the conference a notion I want to further explore here.,Specifically it seems that self-quantification has a really important prevalent and somewhat ironic qualitative component. This qualitative component is key in mediating between raw numbers and identity meanings. If self-quantifiers are seeking self-knowledge through numbers then narratives and subjective interpretations are the mechanisms by which data morphs into selves. Self-quantifiers don't just use data to learn about themselves but rather use data to construct the stories that they tell themselves about themselves.,My friend for example works to maintain a healthy body and relatedly maintains self-views as a healthy and health-conscious person. Caloric over-consumption threatens this view. The story that perceived caloric overconsumption tells her about herself is a troubling one. It disrupts her health-conscious narrative which because social actors work to maintain stable identity meanings is social psychologically distressing. She knows on an implicit level that the data cannot speak for itself and so she gives the data voice-her own voice-and guides the story in identity affirming ways. Of course if the data strayed too far if for instance she went beyond her caloric allotment consistently she would need to re-construe her story to make sense of the lapse and/or alter her identity meanings to create a new self-story altogether (e.g. from "I'm the kind of person who maintains a healthy body weight" to "I'm the kind of person who chooses not to prioritize body size").,One example I gave during my presentation really speaks to the qualitative component of self-quantification. At a QS meetup a woman named Nancy Daugherty talks about tracking her smiles via an EEG sensor with LED lights. She notices that she "lights up" when talking with co-workers in very instrumental ways (you can watch Daugherty's full talk below). As a sociologist my first inclination is to make sense of this in terms of gender training. Women are taught to smile during interaction and so it is unsurprising that a woman would find herself with a smile upon her face without consciousness of it being there-and without a clear feeling of joy ostensibly signified by a smile. However Daughtery interprets her smiles differently. She "realizes" that her interactions with co-workers are more meaningful than she has been giving them credit for and reinterprets these relationships accordingly.,Which one of us is more "correct" is a moot point.,Rather the point of interest is that the same raw data can take on multiple meanings with quite different behavioral and perceptual outcomes. With my structurally based attribution the data may reveal to a woman her own oppression and guide her away from compulsory accommodation and sweetness of demeanor. With Daugherty's socio-emotional interpretation the data reveal unrecognized warmth between this woman and her colleagues and guides her to further appreciate these interactions on a personal level. Far from a precise tool with which the data prosumer reveals scientific Truth the data act more like a word bank with which the data prosumer pieces together an artistic construction-a poem a story an arranged collage of the self.,This theme of self-qualification within self-quantification came up during the discussion portion of the Bodies & Bits panel of which I was a part (along with Christina Dunbar-Hester Gina Neff & Brittany Fiore-Silfvast and John Michalczyk). In the video linked here (~3:50:00) we see one audience member ask about the origins of more data as necessarily better. Whitney Erin Boesel (@phenatpyical) Gina Neff (@Ginasue) and I all trouble this question noting the ways in which within self-quantification usable data is far more important than large amounts of data.,I think Whitney says it best when she refers to a QS talk entitled "I Have all of This Data Now What?"  The Now What? requires subjective interpretation and qualitative story telling. The Quantified Self takes shape through qualification.,The qualification of the self is more than just a post-test tool. Self-qualification is present from the beginning as decisions about what to measure and how to do so are highly subjective and rest upon subject narratives.,Tracking mood for example is rooted in a value for particular kinds of moods over others (typically the preference for happiness over melancholy). Tracking physical activity is rooted in a value of a thin body over a large one. If the goal of a self-quantifier is to construct an improved future-self one must determine who they want that self to be. What is the story that they hope to tell about themselves?,Self quantification is a process bookended by self qualification. Yes the numbers are important. Self-quantification is by definition self-knowledge through numbers. Those numbers however take shape qualitatively. They become the code with which self-quantifiers prosume selves and identities into being. They are the bits with which self-quantifiers make sense of their atoms.,Headline Pic via: http://www.fuelyourwriting.com/files/1295468414_writing450.jpg,Jenny Davis is a weekly contributor on Cyborgology.

But there's always a rub.,When you move your life onto the web you lose control of your data. And - who knows? - your web app of choice may even vanish from the face of the Earth while you're still using it. Think Google Reader.,The growing Indie Web Movement hopes to alleviate these problems working to give web users more control over their online data and identity. The latest example is an open source software tool called Huginn.,Huginn works a lot like popular web services such as IFTTT ("If This Then That") Zapier and Yahoo Pipes. It's a platform for running web bots - called "agents" - that can gather information from across the net and ping you when certain things happen.,The difference is that it's open source software that runs on your own server. That means you control the data it collects and creates.,Huginn can notify you when your favorite sites are updated aggregate your location check-ins over time or warn you the day before it's supposed to snow. But the most interesting tool may be the one that monitors keywords on Twitter and notifies you when everyone starts talking about stuff you're interested in.,,But that's just the beginning. Developers can build more "agents" for the platform. The software is named after the ravens of Norse mythology Huginn and Muninn who travel the world collecting information for the god Odin.,But the point says Andrew Cantino the creator of Huginn is that it's not Pipes or IFTTT. "Pipes isn't really being maintained" says Andrew Cantino the creator of Huginn. "If This Then That seems to be doing well but I don't really know if it's going to stick around. Ultimately I don't control the data.",Cantino says he created the software for his own use and he almost didn't open source Huginn. But he's glad it did. The response has been enormous. It garnered over 1200 stars on it first day on the source-code-hosting-site GitHub.,Cantino doesn't have any plans to turn Huginn into a business as of yet. Before seeing the response to the application he wasn't even considering the idea. He works for the web-based project management software company Mavenlink which doesn't leave him with a lot of time on his hands.,"If I did turn it into a business I would have to be very careful about how I did it. People need to own their data" he says. He's reluctant to create a hosted version of the application saying some of the tools - such as site scraping - could be easily abused. But if he did he would make it possible for users to export their data.,In the meantime he wants to make it easier for users to get started hosting their own version of the software. He says that once it's deployed Huginn is pretty easy to use. Unless you wan to create custom agents you don't need to do any programming. But it would be hard for a non-program to set the application up to begin with. He says developers on GitHub are already working on a version that is easy to deploy to Amazon EC2 or Heroku.,He also hopes to see the number of agents grow. He thinks some sort of directory of agents will prove useful and perhaps a marketplace for people to sell agents they've built will make sense.,Nothing is perfect. The sites that Huginn monitors can change or disappear. But it does give users a permanent repository for the data it collects. It's a welcome addition to other indie web projects likedecentralized wiki inspired by GitHub and created by Ward Cunningham - the creator of the original wiki - and ThinkUp a tool that lets users backup and analyze everything they post to social media sites.,(via Open Source Project Mimics Yahoo Pipes on Your Own Machine | Wired Enterprise | Wired.com), , , , , , , , ,tech,opensource,big data,ownership,indieweb,identity, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjwx3wYTKz1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:peaks-660x536.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

My new Forrester report published today takes on that question. It's called "Smart Body Smart World" and it describes the paradigm shift in computing that we see happening now. Computing has evolved from the mainframe to the desktop to the shoulder bag to the pocket and now computing is taking over new frontiers: Our physical bodies and the physical environments we inhabit.,When we look at new sensor-laden devices (SLDs) like the larklife or Progressive Snapshotwe see the beginnings of a new phase of personal computing that will transform the way we live and work. Sensor-collected data when combined with intelligence and advice will influence our decision-making and self-expression in domains as diverse as health finance shopping navigation relationships work and communication. SLDs could take any shape; in this report we talk about them in two broad categories:,Wearables. "Wearables"-devices worn in or on the body-include accessories like Google Glass or the Nike+ FuelBand but can also include electronics actually enmeshed in our skin and organs like the "electronic tattoos" developed by Nanshu Lu at the University of Texas at Austin or the heads-up display contact lenses developed by researchers at Washington University (one of whom Babak Parviz is now leading Project Glass at Google). ,Embedded devices. By "embedded devices" we mean sensors integrated into otherwise "dumb" objects such as textiles toothbrushes pill boxes mattresses mirrors thermostats doorways steering wheels or parking spots. These devices are sometimes called "The Internet of Things.",Wearables collect data about our physical bodies; embedded devices collect data about the physical environments we inhabit. When we use the data collected by these devices to make information-enhanced decisions we create a paradigm we call "smart body smart world." It's hard to overstate how different our lives will be when the smart body smart world paradigm is in full force. For consumers effects are likely to be positive and negative: With more information and guidance humans can make more "rational" decisions but if we're always listening to our devices we may experience less spontaneity too. For product strategists designing for more simpatico human-device interactions means that:,Devices diversify. Computing devices will take all different shapes and interfaces in some cases will be invisible. Companies like HP making devices in box-shapes must diversify or sacrifice growth.,Big data gets enormous. The thousands of data points per minute collected by sensors on the body and in the environment have to be stored managed normalized and interpreted; products and services that manage and parse this data see tremendous growth.,Verticals fuse: "Health and wellness" is not its own silo but is connected to our finances our shopping habits our relationships. As bodies get connected everyone is in the body business.,Retail disperses: All retailers become computing retailers and computing-specific retailers like Best Buy go the way of Blockbuster. You wouldn't buy a smart toothbrush at a specialty CE store; you'd be more likely to buy it in the channel that solves the rest of your hygiene needs.,Research gets more complete and "objective" input. Academic medical and market researchers will have access to vast detailed data sets of actual not reported human behavior.,There's a lot more to say about this topic; I encourage clients to read our report and get in touch if you'd like to discuss it further.,(via: http://blogs.forrester.com/sarah_rotman_epps/12-10-17-smart_body_smart_world_the_next_phase_of_personal_computing), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,big data,hardware,wearables,embedded devices,electronic tattoo,quantified self, , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

With size tempo colour and brightness they stand up as individuals within the urban nightscape. Many of them send out their luminous messages in a broadcast mode. For this reason neighbours on occasion demand an intense dialogue with regard to content and form of the media façade especially as it's often unclear whether light installations are architecture or advertisement.,However in the same way a good book requires a storyteller media facades demand curators to arrange exciting stories that fit into the site and suit the client. The following four examples show how media facades reflect the story of the buildings themselves – see them all after the break…,Bix Installation / realities:united,Awarded for the category "Animated architecture" by the Media Architecture Biennale 2012 the BIX installation by realities:united at the Kunsthaus Graz is one of the first examples in which media became a part of the architecture itself. Integrated into the overall building concept and planning process this media façade is driven by narrative content forming an identity for the building. Even though the low image resolution induced strong limitations it eliminated the option to use the media façade as a TV gadget like many other media screens. ,Iluma Facade / realities:united,Whereas New York Times Square is a commercially-driven space filled with large advertisements that asks for minimum light levels to keep the story of a vibrant hot spot alive other regions try to minimize the light emission in order to maintain a dark sky without light pollution. The central Orchard Road in Singapore for example has turned into a fascinating location for more architecturally orientated media facades.,The white crystal structure for the Iluma façade in Singapore again by realities:united stays away from highly naturalistic images and conventional LED screens in order to avoid the impression of ordinary high-resolution advertisement screens. Realities:united induced low resolution solutions with artistic content so the pixel itself forms an aesthetic quality at night as well as during the daytime. Abstract dynamic light patterns attract attention for urban orientation and welcome customers. The crystalline forms also evoke associations to diamonds and thereby underline the high-class brand image.,In some European cities the argument of implementing artistic content as in the Iluma facade also opens doors for the building approval process. Certain cities tend to minimize or avoid LED screens for advertisements due to urban space and road safety issues. However if builder-owners start off with an artistic media façade concept their chance for approval increases. An interesting question for future media façade regulations will be if these luminous interfaces will be designed as a part of the façade and would thereby undergo the normal planning approval process or if they will be regarded as interior design elements like curtains for example and would not require any permission.,Dexia Towers / lab-au,Originally meant to act as a beacon for the city of Brussels displaying for example interactive scenarios or temperature and weather forecasts the Dexia Towers came to represent the financial crisis. When the maintenance budget for the media facades was lowered the colourful storytelling was drastically reduced from all night to a 10-minute period every hour. ,Green Pix Zero Energy Media Wall / Arup ,Could media façades represent a green story? Even with efficient LED technology it will be an ambitious path to include large media facades in green buildings with energy labels. ,However China chose an exceptional strategy to define a benchmark for green luminous storytelling. The Green Pix media facade includes photovoltaic modules to gain energy free of charge by absorbing sunlight in the daytime and converting the energy into artistic stories at night. ,Of course the energy specialists know that vertical photovoltaic modules do not provide the most efficient sun orientation. Yet today's media world looks for iconic images that are easy to read and to communicate. Would the world be able to capture this concept as a green story if the solar cells were hidden on the roof with a better sun orientation?,Click here to view the embedded video.,Light matters a monthly column on light and space is written by Thomas Schielke.

This functional and spatial evolution is transforming many city airports into airport cities." - Dr. John Kasarda,Major international airports have developed over time into key nodes in global production and enterprise systems through speed agility and connectivity. These transportation hubs are able to dramatically stimulate local economies by attracting a wide range of aviation-related businesses to their peripheries and resulting in what John Kasarda a US academic who studies and advises governments on city planning issues has dubbed the "Aerotropolis." The Aerotropolis like any other traditional city consists of a central core with rings of development permeating outwards; unlike a traditional city however the city's core is an airport and all neighboring development supports and is supported in turn by the airport industry. Several airports around the globe have organically evolved into these airport-dependent communities generating huge economic profits and creating thousands of jobs but what Kasarda is arguing for is a more organized and purposeful approach to the development of these Aerotropolises – what he believes to be the future model of a successful city.,Read on for more on the Aerotropolis vision.,Looking back on city development it quickly becomes clear that cities have almost always been an outcome of and had a strong relationship with the form of transportation that was relevant during the time of their establishments. In the US the first modern cities developed around seaports (Boston Charleston NYC) and then towns popped up along rivers and canals (Buffalo Pittsburgh Detroit). Next the invention of the railroad opened up previously hard-to-reach inland areas to manufacturing and distribution (Atlanta Omaha Kansas City). In the 20th century highways facilitated the greater dispersion of people and companies by creating suburbs and most recently the world's airports have turned into "primary drivers of urban growth international connectivity and economic success.",Kasarda claims that the cities that will thrive in the 21st century will be those with airports and their centers for "efficient large well-connected airports matter to prosperity above everything else" and "the fastest best-connected places will win.",These words certainly have not fallen on deaf ears. Airport cities have already appeared in Amsterdam Zuidas Las Colinas Texas and New Songdo South Korea's International Business District. Dubai is currently considered to be the world's largest aerotropolis connecting the East and West primarily through international air travel and commerce; however OMA has just revealed masterplans for a competitive airport city in Qatar. Plans for a China Southern Airport City by Woods Bagot are underway as well – in fact China is reportedly building a total of 100 airports to be completed by the year 2020. Nearby Taiwan has allocated $8 billion for just one airport while the US allocated a similar amount – $9 billion – for all transportation infrastructure in 2008. With this kind of indifference towards its airports Kasarda warns that America's economy runs the risk of falling behind these other developing nations.,A nation's airports are undeniably vital contributors to the economy. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is the 2nd largest office market in the Midwest and Washington Dulles's airport area alone has more retail sales than any other American city besides Manhattan. Detroit a city that is seriously considering a new airport development to stimulate its struggling economy would generate $10 billion in annual economic activity $171 million in annual tax revenue and would create and sustain 64000 jobs after 25 years. Why would anyone living in Detroit today frown upon a proposition like this?,Well while the economic effects of the Aerotropolis are clear its effects on an existing urban fabric and its people are much less so. This is evident in the current issues facing London and its new major airport in southeast England a task that has drawn many of the world's leaders in business planning and architecture. After considering the Aerotropolis city model Rowan Moore of The Guardian finds it "chilling: a model of a city driven by a combination of business imperatives and state control with the high levels of security and control that go with airports. Under the dictatorship of speed individual memory and identity are abolished. An airport shopping mall is actually not like a town square [as Kasarda suggests] for the reason that everything there is programmed and managed and spontaneity and initiative are abolished.",In addition he notes that Kasarda's model envisions the Aerotropolis being constructed on "virgin greensward" which is simply impossible for London and most existing metropolitan areas. It turns into a challenge of reorienting an entire city to focus on its airport – a monumental effort when working with a metropolis that has hundreds if not thousands of years of history and urban growth. The model could work seamlessly where there's a blank slate but there just aren't enough of those left in the world.,While the Aerotropolis vision is an economically enticing one and has already set many gears in motion around the globe we need to stop and consider the bigger picture: how will this model change the way we experience cities? Will individual culture and character be lost to the fast-paced constantly-connected and homogenized aura of air travel or allow for a greater cultural exchange? How will it affect the human psyche and will the preoccupation with money and control eventually replace all other knowledge or will it create new knowledge as a result?,What do you think?,Click here to view the embedded video.,References: The Guardian Aerotropolis.com Endeavors   ,Aerotropolis: The Key to a Prosperous 21st Century City? originally appeared on ArchDaily the most visited architecture website on 19 Mar 2013.,send to Twitter | Share on Facebook | What do you think about this?,http://bit.ly/15mB8SP, , , , , , , , ,airports,architecture,mobility, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx2diHdfC1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:11aKh0e,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:11eYNba,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:11eYNbc, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This drive to accumulate knowledge to understand the world in its infinite complexity and create the visual tools to do so is at the heart of the exhibition Gioni is currently preparing for the biennial's eagerly awaited International Pavilion. The show embraces curiosity pushed to the point of "obsession" of "delirium" he said.,"The Encyclopaedic Palace" features over 150 artists from 37 countries and it borrows its title from a utopian project by architect Marino Auriti. In 1955 the Italian American eccentric devised and patented the design for a building destined to contain all human knowledge. The actual palace was never made but its spectacular maquette will have a place of honour in Venice sitting alongside works by several so-called outsider artists (James Castle Augustin Lesage Aleister Crowley) biennial veterans (Fischli/Weiss Steve McQueen Cindy Sherman Bruce Nauman) and intriguing artefacts including Carl Jung's "Red Book" (gathering drawings of his patients' visions) and French thinker Roger Callois's collection of stones.,This biennial job is recognition of the unstoppable rise of the Italian-born New York-based curator Gioni who has gained critical acclaim for such shows as the Gwangju Biennial (2010) "Younger Than Jesus" at the New Museum (2009) and the Berlin Biennial (which he helmed in collaboration with his long-time friends and collaborators Maurizio Cattelan and Ali Subotnick). If one believes the Wall Street Journal Gioni is the "crowned prince of the art world. After the press conference ARTINFO UK got the chance to ask Gioni a few questions about the upcoming show. ,How did you come across Marino Auriti?,I've been including artists that are defined as "outsider" or "self-taught" in my shows for a while. It was the idea already for the Gwangju Biennial in 2010 and I've been looking at that field quite regularly in my group shows at the New Museum. Auriti's piece is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum (New York) so I had heard about it. I saw it in person not that long ago like 2011. As the ideas for the Venice exhibition were developing I thought that somehow it was the ideal starting point. I like the fact that it's an actual object that contains a very peculiar story and I like the idea of naming the biennial after a specific object and not just a random idea. Auriti not only encapsulates some of the themes of the show but he also came to incarnate one of the exhibition's larger questions which is the distinction between the professional and the self-taught or the professional and the autodidact.,This seems to be very much the zeitgeist. I was talking to James Brett earlier today and he reckons that the Museum of Everything he founded is a key reference for the biennial.,I like James I think he's part of a change that has been in the air but I don't know if I would say that the whole biennial comes from the Museum of Everything. When you make a show like [the one in] Venice you have to grasp a moment in time so I wanted to include these less canonical artists as a recognition of a movement that has become more and more prominent in the last few years. The Hamburger Bahnhof for example has dedicated a series of shows to outsider artists and only a few weeks ago the New York Times's Roberta Smith was advocating for the inclusion of outsider artists in mainstream museums. At the same time the inclusion of those artists helped the biennial to move away from a more predictable - I hope - list of artists.,,More and more I'm interested in visual culture or figurative expression rather than just contemporary art. This is to expand the dialogue and to move away from the accepted canon. It's also because I think one of the most pressing questions [to interrogate] is the role of art and artists in our "image society." To do that you cannot just look at contemporary art. You have to look a little further and that's why I included those artists. I think they provide interesting examples of attitudes towards image-making image-arrangement and image consumption that are important to look at to understand how we can engage with visual culture today.,,The way we know biennials in the last 10-15 years is very much one of the paradigms. It's not the way biennials have always been. If you look at the Venice biennial throughout its 110-year history there have been many examples of exhibitions that didn't look just at the present but offered more historical overviews and included historical more unusual materials.,Even as recently as the last edition in which Bice Curiger included three paintings by Tintoretto.,Yes but here I think there is a more organic reflection on the past. There's been a lot of hype about the fact that I'm the youngest curator in the history of the biennial. And I feel that what belongs to my generation – even though I don't want to be a spokesperson for my generation – is a sense of synchronicity that is very new. Being in the present being contemporary means that there is an access to history or to information that is quite unusual. So that's what the show does in its own structure and it's also what the show talks about. It's an exhibition that looks at the birth of our knowledge society and of our information society and tries to show that this state of being over-informed is not just a recent phenomenon but something that has been going on for some time.,Your title seems to ironize the idea of the biennial itself.,I don't know if ironic is the right term. Definitely the dream of the "Encyclopaedic Palace" resembles the expectations we have about these shows. So choosing this piece as a starting point and recognizing that it never came to completion is a way to suggest the expectation that a biennial could encapsulate universal knowledge is doomed to fail.,The architecture of the actual "Encyclopaedic Palace" is very much inspired by the architecture of the Chicago International Expo and the all sorts of international exhibitions and the Venice Biennial is among the biennials the one that most directly relates to London's Great Exhibition. I wanted to hint at that show that this dream is tinted by many other problems and also that it may be ultimately impossible. So why would I be expected to fulfil it?,What do you think the Venice Biennial represents today?,What keeps the biennial unique is first its historical legacy. I always tell the artists that come and visit: to think that Gustav Klimt was showing there in 1905 is mind-blowing and means that for 110 years they've been getting it quite right. If you look at the list of artists many have also been forgotten and that's just the way history or histories operate. The legacy is also important because it contains different models of what the biennial can be.,Secondly there is the element of the national pavilions which present an idea of being contemporary that is incredibly polyphonic. Being contemporary today in India is not the same thing as being contemporary in Bahrain and that puts a relativistic element on my show - it becomes just one of the voices.,As a curator it's also a show that you do only once so I felt the need to do something unusual. I don't know how unusual it will feel but I'm trying to make a show that I don't see out there. People will decide if it is or not.,Yet in your list of artists there are many artists we are very familiar with and it does feel quite predominantly Euro-American.,There are 38 nations that's much more than the last and the previous one. There are more artists from Asia and South America than in the last biennial. Seven or eight are from South America. Because it's a bigger list – the last two were 80 names – and because there are many historical artists maybe you get a perspective distortion.,art,venice biennale,knowledge, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx4g6KDOV1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Whether it be a citizen an end-user or a resident how can lighting create a sociality between these individuals and meet their different needs.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE THEME « To an era of strictly functional public lighting followed a period where using lighting as tools of heritage beautification developed rapidly. Wouldn't it now be time to think of the users and to invent what we could call a social light meaning a light and ambiance responsive to the needs the experiences and emotions of the users and citizens?  -  Roger Narboni : Ambiances et atmosphère en lumière urbaine The 2013 edition of the CLU Foundation's competition invites participants to consider the role of lighting in the urban areas of tomorrow. Think of the future. Imagine urban neighborhoods where there are for example no cars that the territory belongs to the people and that we put value in community natural recreational and social environments. Whether it be a citizen resident or end-user how can lighting be conceived around this individual with needs emotions and desires. Professionals in landscape architecture architecture or urban planning recognize that neighborhoods need to reinvent themselves. We must put aside our paradigms and open ourselves to new ideas. Functional needs of urban lighting such as security traffic and signaling have been met with rational responses by designers. But if we look at lighting solutions from a completely different angle bringing light to a person could generate a feeling of well-being a sense of belonging to a place or be a way to create a strong identity. In this context should we review the traditional luminous object that can be found everywhere? How will this physically change the light source? Without falling into the clichés of Utopia,How will the many technological innovations in light help us improve the urban experience?,How will they shape the life of the city in various public spaces parks and other areas that make up a neighborhood?,How will the different modes of transport influence the way we illuminate the city?,Will we use street lighting as tools that will improve and favor the well-being of the user as tools of communication or as tools to create different moods?,It is clear that with the transformation of urban centers we will need to propose new solutions to adjust to the new urban realities. These are questions that challenge the members of the CLU Foundation. Now it is up to you lighting entusiasts to reflect and propose your vision of the role of urban lighting for tomorrow.REGISTRATION Registration to the 2013 CLU fondation contest is free.

The second showed how these customers were billed for using the service and this was about 10 gigabytes. Google wanted to examine the relationship between these two enormous collections of information so it shuttled both into a service it calls BigQuery. With BigQuery the company merged the data in about 60 seconds according to Google man Ju-kay Kwek and it could then zero in on the results for each individual App Engine user.,When you're dealing with such large data sets 60 seconds is pretty darn quick. And this didn't require any specialized programming. Google was using standard tools built into BigQuery and as the company announced late last week these tools are now available to the world at large.,The tools mimic the sort of rapid queries that have long been possible on ordinary databases via the structure query language or SQL. The difference is that Google is doing this on such large amounts of data.,The latest incarnation of Google BigQuery is yet another example of the way today's "Big Data" tools - tools designed to process mega amounts of information - are evolving to behave more and more like traditional databases.,In October Silicon Valley startup Cloudera uncloaked a tool called Impala that's designed to run rapid queries on massive data sets and this month tech giant EMC followed with a similar tool. Based on aninternal Google software platform called Dremel Big Query predates both these tools and Google continues to fine-tune it.,Last week the company unveiled two new tools atop BigQuery. "Big JOIN" lets you combine data in much the same way Google merged its two App Engine data sets while "Big Group Aggregations" let you divide such data into specific segments as Google did in setting up separate App Engine datasets for each user.,Join is a common SQL operation. Basically it lets you combine two different datasets so that they can be analyzed in data. Big Query could do joins in the past but according to Ju-kay Kwek who oversees BigQuery as project manager it was better suited to other types of queries. "We had a lot of people request the ability to do joins on very large tables" Kwek tells Wired. "It's not to say Big Query couldn't do that before…but doing a join on such a large dataset is a non-trivial problem and in terms of performance Big Query wasn't ideally suited to it.",Various tools have long offered the ability to run SQL queries atop Big Data platforms such as Hadoop but this often requires a fair amount of time - if not some specialized programming skills. But tools like Dremel and BigQuery aim to change this.,In 2010 Google released a research paper describing Dremel - a software platforms that pools the power of hundreds of computer servers - and it caused a bit of a stir in the academic community. According to Google's paper the tool could run queries on multiple petabytes of data - millions of gigabytes - in a matter of seconds. "If you had told me beforehand me what Dremel claims to do I wouldn't have believed you could build it" Armando Fox a professor of computer science at the University of California Berkeley once told us.,Google never released the software behind Dremel but with BigQuery it lets anyone use this software atop its own infrastructure. In order to use the service you must format your data using the CSV or JSON standard and upload it onto Google's machines. You can stream your data straight into BigQuery proper or you have the option of grabbing and analyzing data housed on Google Cloud Storage a general storage service for housing massive data sets online. Google has also teamed with companies such as Informatica and Talend to offer tools that can more easily move data into BigQuery from local software applications.,Separately a Silicon Valley outfit called MapR is working to build an open source version of Dremel. This is known as Drill and you would have the option of running this on your own servers.,(via Google BigQuery Ratchets Up Evolution of New-Age Data Analysis | Wired Enterprise | Wired.com), , , , , , , , , , , ,big data,google,big query,analysis,computation,big data tools, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjxw6uMD5K1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Body-generated data could be applied to any domain such as relationships productivity gaming shopping personal safety and identity validation just to name a few possibilities.,I recently participated in a panel in San Francisco hosted by service design agencyFjord along with Adam Gazzaley Director of the Neuroscience Imaging Center at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF); Bill Geiser CEO of MetaWatch; Sonny Vu CEO of Misfit Wearables; and Olof Schybergson CEO of Fjord. With perspectives from science research product and design all represented we had diverse points of view but all saw the same challenges ahead for wearables: designing for the human brain.,No I'm not talking about sensors implanted in your brain (although that's certainly possible and already happening in research and medical settings). I'm talking about designing for the nuanced way our brains process the experience of wearing a device.,In particular we all saw a need for wearables that: Support rather than distract from goal-oriented behavior. ,Dr. Gazzaley's research at UCSF explicitly focuses on this topic: how goal-oriented behavior is affected by distraction. On the panel he joked "I'm the guy reporters call when they want someone to say distraction is bad.",But it's not that simple: Dr. Gazzaley noted that if devices are designed with the brain's limitations in mind they could be used to support rather than distract from goal-oriented behavior. For example he said we know that humans are not very good at staying alert while driving. If a wearable could be designed to detect when we're falling asleep at the wheel and alert us before we do that could literally save lives.,Increase self-awareness but not to the point of self-consciousness. As I've tested various wearable devices I've found that wearing an activity tracker like the UP does have a positive effect on my activity during the day - I'm more aware of my sedentary behavior and more likely to walk when I can like pacing the platform while waiting for the train instead of standing still.,But I've found that wearing a tracker to sleep introduces an unwelcome element of self-consciousness into my bedroom: I'm paying attention (and not in a good way) to how long it takes me to fall asleep.,And what about sex? Should some elements of our lives remain untracked? (I argue yes; others may disagree.),Fjord CEO Olof Schybergson predicted that we'll need new rules of engagement when wearables like Google Glass allow us to record our surroundings invisibly. In business meetings or on dates for example self-consciousness could detract from trust in our relationships.,Give feedback but avoid "chart fatigue." All the panelists agreed that feedback is an important element of why wearables work: That's why the Misfit Shine has LEDs that light up to show your progress toward your daily activity goal. In Dr. Gazzaley's lab experiments he often uses gamification strategies precisely for this reason - achievements progression and competition are powerful and addictive incentives to keep doing something.,But Schybergson noted that the novelty of data quickly wears off and erodes into "chart fatigue." For wearables to keep our attention over the long term they need to be "living services" evolving as we evolve.,Lead image by Dane Frederiksen picturing Bill GeiserSonny Vu and Olof Schybergson (left to right).,(via Wearable Devices' Next Design Challenge: The Human Brain – ReadWrite), , , , , , , , , ,hardware,wearables,quantified self,big data,brain,body, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjxxy1vdr91s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:fuelband.jpeg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:Screen%20Shot%202013-02-01%20at%205.55.37%20PM.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:larklife-band-with-ios-app.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Nanshu Lu is developing long-lasting "electronic tattoos" that can bond to skin and track and report on the wearer's vital signs or translate small muscle movements into commands for controlling devices. Future versions may play critical roles inside the body in watching for signs of disease or damage. They could even treat problems automatically.Lu an assistant professor in the department of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin has solved a big problem in building electronics for biological tissue: silicon semiconductor circuits are flat rigid and brittle making them a terrible match for the soft pliable tissue. (See "Making Stretchable Electronics") What is needed is a soft device better able to make intimate contact with skin. To create a more tissue-friendly chip Lu enlisted a flexible polymer substrate on which she could deposit small islands of silicon. That technique had been tried by other researchers but these devices had limited flexibility since ordinary wires used to connect the silicon tear as the substrate stretches or twists with the tissue's movement. Lu solved the wiring problem by eliminating the islands and replacing them with a serpentine mesh of nanoribbons; this webbing stands up to twisting and pulling without breaking. The resulting device is a 30-micrometer-thick patch of supersoft transparent silicone. Lu has built a prototype of the device that carries sensors to measure temperature strain and electrical signals. The patch could also be equipped with LEDs to enable visual signaling.,The circuits are printed onto silicone that's supported by a stiffer layer of water-soluble polymer. When the patch is placed on dry skin and then wetted the polymer layer dissolves; intermolecular attractions between the silicone and skin make the silicone adhere tightly. In tests the silicone patches have adhered to skin for a week hanging on even through showers and exercise. And the patches don't irritate skin the way adhesives often do.Lu and collaborators have already tested the devices in a few applications. For example they have been attached to people's necks to enable them to control Sokoban games simply by speaking commands; the patches measure the electrical activity of throat muscles during speech with enough fidelity to distinguish between the spoken words "left" "right" "up" and "down." Now Lu wants to see the patches used in a wide variety of health-related applications. She hopes to stick the devices on foreheads to directly monitor electrical activity in the brain to place them on skin during plastic surgery so that strain gauges on the patch can alert surgeons if the procedure is overly stretching skin to monitor heart rate and muscle activity during exercise and to track the progress of healing in wounds and burns.Lu is working on new versions of the devices. For example she's trying to create stronger physical and electrical connections by integrating arrays of microneedles on the bottom of the silicone patches. That in turn could enable the patches to stick to heart muscle so doctors could detect early signs of heart-attack risk such as reduced blood flow. Lu also hopes that a version of the patch with two-way communication capabilities might be able to sense heart arrhythmias and instantly respond by delivering small electric shocks to restore an even beat. And she envisions transdermal electronics that could detect the level of a protein in the body associated with a specific disorder and then release drugs to treat it. ,,(via Innovator Under 35: Nanshu Lu 29 - MIT Technology Review), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,hardware,wearables,electronic tattoo,body,skin,sensor, , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjxyaksgkC1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:printable.skin_.electronicsx299.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:printable.skin_.electronics.2x299.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Unfortunately that's beginning to happen to "collaborative consumption" (or "the sharing economy" if you wish).,When I first became aware of it in 2009 I saw it as a part of a movement of movements rising from the grassroots to give ordinary people the tools needed to take control of their economic destinies. It fit neatly in with open source software peer-to-peer networks the cooperative movement and crowdfunding and seemed a natural extension of social media into "meatspace.",I was also excited about its potential for good. Take car sharing for example - every shared car replaces up to 13 owned cars 50 percent of people join to get access to a car who didn't have access before and for every 15000 cars a city takes off the ownership rolls it could keep an estimated $127 million in the local economy annually. It's taking things that sit idly by and suddenly making them productive again. I didn't know of any other social innovation that could reduce consumption increase access to important physical assets like cars and grow the local economy simultaneously.,I imagined an entire economy based on access versus ownership which was just what the doctor ordered in an era of economic and environmental crises.,That said the thing that really spoke to me as a kid who barely made it out of the suburbs with his sanity was the potential to transform culture from a toxic "keep up with the Joneses" mentality to more positive "collaborate with the Jones." For early advocates like me better relationships and experiences were big reasons we thought it would succeed and one of the main benefitThat's right. I'm not your typical PandoDaily guest poster. You won't hear me wax on about the latest Series A acqui-hire or IPO.,Instead I want to talk about how money is ruining what started out as a transformative concept.,(PandoDaily's own Erin Griffith also recently took on this issue in her post "Does money taint the sharing economy?"),I'm not surprised that collaborative consumption is suffering growing pains. This is what happens when a flood of VC money focuses startups on growth at the expense of benefitting humanity. Some changes are symbolic yet telling like Airbnb ditching their "travel like a human" tag line. Some are substantive like Zipcar being absorbed by an old line car rental company Avis. And some are anecdotal like the fact that my Airbnb rentals of late have been much more impersonal than back in the day which is totally understandable if you're adding new properties at the fastest possible rate through every channel including the fount of all mediocre customers Google Adwords.,Herein lies the rub. As collaborative consumption goes mainstream it risks losing the very thing that attracted people in the first place the unique and even transformative social experiences made possible when you interact with helpful strangers. With this potential loss goes an important part of the positive impact and a straight-up competitive advantage worthy of any Harvard MBA's lust.,And what is this competitive advantage? Well take my first experience renting a car on Getaround. When I met Sarah to pick up her car DaffodillPickle we struck up a conversation about aquaponics she gave me an impromptu tour of her aquaponics setup on her balcony and then sent me on my way with fresh strawberries she picked for me on the spot. That made my day.,That's never going to happen at Hertz because this kind of intimacy can never be scaled.,So it's not so much that collaborative consumption is dead it's more that it risks dying as it gets absorbed by the "Borg" and its mindless minions of capitalism. Nothing new or special here of course. As a recent Atlantic Cities feature concluded collaborative consumption is just more efficient which isn't all bad. In a recent Economist cover story Tim O'Reilly says this loss of revolutionary potential is inevitable. He's wrong though. It's only inevitable if a company takes VC money. It's really just a decision.,This is where the real sharing economy comes in. It is more than just VC-backed Internet startups. It's a tectonic shift in how the economy works. As society changes from a top-down factory model of organization to a peer-to-peer network model how we produce consume and interact will be radically transformed. At its simplest the sharing economy is the decentralization of economic power brought on by new technology new and revived business models and massive social change. It's made up of thousands of innovations some for profit some nonprofit and some that thrive in the commons.,If we can avert our collective gaze from our latest technology gadgets for a second we might be able to see the real sharing economy the one driven by values and tested by time.,Below are some of the most important and overlooked parts of it:,Cooperatives,As multinational corporations work feverishly to reduce their reliance on human beings member-financed member-owned and democratically managed cooperative businesses are on the rise. In fact they employ more people than multinational corporations. They also pay better wages and their fair share of taxes and weather economic crises better. More than 800 million people worldwide are part of a co-op.,There are whole regions in Spain and Italy dominated by cooperatives and those regions have lower unemployment and a stronger middle class because of co-ops. There's actually a town in Spain Mondragon where virtually everyone is middle class because the largest co-op in the world is headquartered there The Mondragon Corporation and its main goal is full employment not profit.  The UN declared 2012 the International Year of the Cooperative to recognize coops proven ability to create jobs and alleviate poverty around the world. Co-ops have been growing steadily worldwide for centuries.,Open Source Software,There are more than 200000 open source software projects that are worth a combined half a trillion dollars. The Internet practically runs on software made for free by programmers all over the world. We wouldn't have such a robust tech startup scene without it as startups rely on open source tools to build their services.,Public Banking,Public banks are government-owned banks that lend responsibly at low rates to their citizens and contribute earnings to government treasuries.,There are many public banks in the world but North Dakota has the only public bank in the US the Bank of North Dakota (BND). BND has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the state treasury while working with private banks to make ample credit available state-wide. It helped stabilize North Dakota during the subprime crisis. John David of the Public Banking Institute says "Currently North Dakota – in part due to the BND's beneficent influence – has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation (just over 4 percent) has no debt to service has a $1.1 billion surplus has experienced no bank failures in the state and is the only state in the last two years to avoid a budget deficit.",The success of The Bank of North Dakota has inspired other states to follow suit. 20 states have public banking legislation in the works.,socialtech,opensource,sharing economy,collaborative consumption,access over ownership,collaboration,peer-to-peer, , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjymkirtm41s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

"Collaborative consumption" as it's also known is more often associated with the big-ticket items that have given the concept such bemusing cachet. Suddenly it seems people are casually lending and borrowing cars bikes even brownstones. But this basic kitchenware hanging in a 7300 square-foot warehouse reveals the reaches to which all this sharing could ultimately expand as well as the reasons why it will have to.,Union Kitchen moved into the space in late November of 2012 taking over what had been the commissary for a chain of local kabob houses. Jonas Singer and Cullen Gilchrist had been looking to expand the kitchen operations for a café they own in the city. But this two-story red brick warehouse situated on a cramped manufacturing block was more space than they needed. So they turned the warehouse – complete with a walk-in freezer two fridges and prep space for two-dozen entrepreneurs – into a shared kitchen and food incubator. For $500 a month member chefs get a share of their own prep table access to communal equipment pantry shelves and ingredients at wholesale prices.,By early January the kitchen already had nearly a dozen members including a cupcake food truck company a caterer specializing in mole sauces and chocolate cakes and the city's lone Kombucha brewer. It would be prohibitively expensive for any of them to open their own commercial kitchens. But – and this is a related problem – there also isn't affordable space enough in this growing city to do so.,"The reality is that if D.C. swells from a place where there are 500000 people in 2010 to a place where there are 850000 in 2020 well what are we doing with those 350000 extra people who are here?" Singer asks sitting on a couch in the kitchen's lounge. "We're all living in slightly smaller spaces. Obviously the per-capita number of car owners has to go down. The amount of space like this is going to be much tighter. A lot of the sharing economy just has to do with the number of people living per square foot of land. It's all about physical space.",The so-called sharing economy has been described as being about many things: Millennials rejecting car ownership the environmentally conscious glomming onto the latest eco-trend broke urbanites who will want all their own stuff again as soon as the economy recovers. Ron J. Williams the CEO of online gear-lending outlet SnapGoods admits that sharing pioneers (himself included) enabled too many articles describing all of this as a precious curiosity: People are sharing whoopee-pie makers! On the Internet! With strangers!,As Singer's kitchen illustrates collective ownership in all its evolving forms constitutes less a fleeting fad and more an essential piece of how we'll live in an increasingly dense urbanized world. This is both a physical and economic reality. "Fundamentally" Singer says "if more people are living on the same square foot of land and that square foot of land is worth more money what are the consequences and how do we set up our society to deal with that? That's what we're trying to wrap our heads around.",Jonas Singer in Union Kitchen.,Sharing is of course an old idea. "This is just Colonial Williamsburg" Singer says invoking eras past and sweeping his arms out to capture the whole building. "That's all this is." Although one persistent problem at Union Kitchen is quite modern: the chaotic parking scene outside on the narrow block shared by an auto mechanic a Chinese noodle shop a woodworker and a printing press. Sharing has its downsides too.,We're used to the notion of sharing libraries public parks and train cars. But in many ways American culture in particular drifted away from sharing as a value when we spread out from city centers and into the suburbs. Molly Turner the director of public policy for short-term rental lodging website Airbnb evokes the iconic image of Richard Nixon in Moscow introducing Nikita Khrushchev to the modern marvel of the state-of-the-art washing machine available for private consumption in every American home. Beginning with the era of that washing machine Turner argues we forgot how to share.,We came to prize instead personal ownership – of multiple cars of large homes with private backyards and space inside for appliances that would never fit in a modest city walk-up. Today this kind of bald consumerism is considered almost tacky. But the reasons underlying that cultural shift reveal why we're witnessing a true change in paradigm. Much has transformed in the last few years alone: the economy technology and the allure of cities themselves.,"What's really going on here is the urbanization of the world and the reurbanization of American cities" Turner says. "Either consciously or subconsciously [people] are realizing that that involves the public realm the commons sharing goods and services and infrastructure. And I think that kind of bleeds into your personal life." In other words if you'll share a subway car why not a kitchen?,People don't want the cognitive load associated with owning.,This move back into city centers also coincided with the Great Recession. Those big houses and multiple cars it turns out were beyond many of our means. And it's no coincidence Turner says that Airbnb – a company founded around shared housing – was born in 2008 just as the U.S. was entering a recession built on a housing crisis. For many Airbnb members the spare rooms they were able to rent through the service helped them keep their homes. City living for all its allure is expensive but the sharing economy makes it possible for more people whether they're sharing a car because they can't afford to own one or sharing a bike because they've got nowhere to store it.,We're also witnessing a paradigm shift toward sharing in the offline world because of the online technology that enables it. None of that technology including Internet payment models network search tools and identity verification systems that make trust at least somewhat possible among strangers is going away. The Internet has essentially allowed us to expand the circle of people with whom we share. But even more fundamentally the open-source culture of the web has taught us how to share and made sharing a default of social interaction.,"There's some pretty good empirical evidence that people in a sense get in a habit of sharing" says Lee Rainie the director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. "It's a frictionless process online and in the digital form. Why wouldn't that be the gateway drug to being a sharer in other contexts?",-       -       -       -       -,Expensive fixed assets like cars and housing have actually turned out to be the low-hanging fruit of the sharing economy. They're costly to own individually making the incentive to share them that much higher. And most cars sit unused for the majority of their lives meaning that owners pay hefty costs to drive them only a fraction of the time.,Getaround a San Francisco-based car-sharing company pushed the idea pioneered by companies like ZipCar even further into the realm of what would once have been considered impossible. The company launched in mid-2011 enables individuals to share their private vehicles. Skeptics insisted that people would never share their own cars (by which they really meant "I would never share mine.") It turned out plenty of other people were willing to take the risk including the owner of a Tesla Roadster. To this day – Getaround has signed up 10000 vehicles in its first year and a half – the sharing service remains the only way you can rent the $150000 sportscar in San Francisco. "That helped a lot of people with Priuses and MINI Coopers share theirs" company founder Jessica Scorpio says.,Airbnb has similarly destigmatized strangers in private homes. Today half of the company's hosts are renting out a spare room living alongside a stranger. The other half turn their empty apartments over to unknown tenants. One of the older companies in the sharing space – at all of four years old – Airbnb has spawned its own share of mimics. "There's such a proliferation of 'the Airbnb of XYZ" Turner says "and I think some of the models probably aren't going anywhere like the 'Airbnb of toilets' or the 'Airbnb of dogs.'" But she predicts that those services meeting the needs of both sides of a market – the givers and receivers in sharing – will succeed. Airbnb for instance has met the need of homeowners looking to make extra money on the side. But it will also increasingly serve a freelance workforce as prone to temporarily changing cities as jobs.,Some physical goods – maybe not dogs or toilets – are exchanging hands in the shared economy too. There actually is someone in Manhattan offering whoopee-pie makers on SnapGoods (includes the recipe book!).,But the shared economy of stuff works best with assets that are expensive to own and infrequently used like camera and music accessories or high-end home tools. SnapGoods sells itself with the slogan "own less do more" a nod to the idea that our culture increasingly values the accumulation of experiences over assets (if you don't own your own camera maybe you can afford to take a trip as an amateur photographer to Yosemite).,"People don't want the cognitive load associated with owning" reasons Neal Gorenflo the publisher of Shareable magazine. "If you're a creative person you don't want to cut the lawn. Or wash your car. It's like 'Oh my god are you kidding me? I could be creating the next piece of software.'",Union Kitchen members prep for an event.,All of these models – alongside bikesharing coworking spaces shared nannies – are really at the end of the day about efficiency even if the shared economy simultaneously speaks to our more altruistic motivations to do right by each other and the environment. Ownership by definition implies idleness. Whatever you own that you're not using right this second may be going to waste. Or worse you're wasting scarce money on it.,socialtech,collaborative consumption,sharing economy,food incubator,access over ownership, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjyn9jh9i21s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:jonas.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:A5BTGPd4nixAFwR0n_gRevn5A56YERFcJhkmm7zfDXE,6W1Z5wjdaG86-fruiNDfGXlKAp9fzeLbPIc5I9zYdI0.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Now artists have begun harnessing the technology as a means of expression and social commentary. At the forefront of this burgeoning movement is BC "Heavy" Biermann.  ,Biermann is a self-taught programmer and transmedia scholar with a foothold in both Los Angeles and St. Louis. His nickname reflects his penchant for "heavy" academic discussion. His art projects often involve overlaying interactive digital facades on public buildings and spaces and have attracted interest from public and technical audiences alike.  ,This month Biermann brings his insight to the IEEE panel "Omnipresent: When Virtual Meets Reality" at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin Texas. The panel will discuss how AR is enhancing design manufacturing and medicine.  ,Photo: Michael Berger A Public Artist: BC" Heavy" Biermann uses augmented reality to transform public spaces.,"Augmented reality will become a more integrated part of our lives. The heavy hitters like Apple Microsoft and Google are recognizing this" Biermann says referring to advances like Google's Project Glass and Microsoft's recent patent for AR glasses both of which will move the technology beyond its current home in smartphones. "The hardware needs to catch up to the software. Until AR can happen in glasses it's not a seamless experience" says Biermann.  ,In 2005 Biermann founded The Heavy Projects (which last year brought aboard the digital media expert Ean Mering) to experiment with urban art and mobile AR technology. The following year Biermann earned a doctorate in humanities and intermedia analysis from the University of Amsterdam. In 2011 he formed Re+Public with Jordan Seiler founder of the PublicAdCampaign-which explores the negative effects of advertising in public spaces-to develop AR that reimagines those spaces.  ,"We're bombarded with commercial messaging whether we want to see it or not" says Biermann. In response Re+Public creates interactive art on buildings in public spaces creating digital murals that can be viewed via software running on a mobile device. "That way not everyone has to see it" he says. "We're creating a platform to suggest how virtual overlay may one day undercut the need for physical advertising." ,Re+Public's first big project was the "AR | AD Takeover" in July 2011 in which viewers held smartphones pointed at specific Times Square billboards to reveal works of original urban-themed art. Following that Re+Public produced projects that enabled viewers to see a decayed Norway mural restored to its original glory three buildings in Los Angeles and New York City augmented with colorful designs an in situ history of murals that once graced the Bowery (also in New York City) and reimagined versions of existing murals in Miami's Wynwood Art District. "We used AR to bring the murals to life by giving them a 3-D environment to 'live' in" Biermann says. "We also animated the murals and made them interactive." ,Until now most people have been able to see videos of these projects only on The Heavy Projects (http://bit.ly/KYAjp8) and Re+Public (http://bit.ly/15YrJTH) sites. But this spring Biermann and his team will make Android and iOS versions of the software available for public download so that people can view them on their mobile devices.  ,The technical challenges are considerable. "It's difficult to do AR like this outdoors" says Biermann. "It's tricky getting the app to be consistent regardless of lighting conditions day or night and people walking in front of the mural."  ,Through The Heavy Projects Biermann is now exploring applications of gaming principles such as choice and narrative in his AR designs giving users options on how to "resurface" buildings so that people can see inside or what they might look like 20 years in the future.  ,In St. Louis he's drawing on architectural tools in a prospective collaboration with Sung Ho Kim an associate professor of architecture at Washington University to digitally revitalize several of the city's buildings. "We would like to allow people to see how cities could look with better urban planning" Biermann says.  ,"Eventually we'll have AR contact lenses and then-and this freaks everyone out-chip implants" he says laughing. "In the not-too-distant future humans will grow up with digital overlays onto the physical world as part of the natural experience. We're in the baby steps of what AR could eventually look like and that's what we're excited about showing people.",http://bit.ly/145W6ZT, , , , , , , , , , ,architecture,augmented reality, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx55iw40e1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLed,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLef, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I ran outside only to discover that a car had smashed into the corner of my house. As I went to speak with the driver he threw the car into reverse and sped off striking me and running over my right foot as I fell to the ground. When his car hit me I was wearing a computerized-vision system I had invented to give me a better view of the world. The impact and fall injured my leg and also broke my wearable computing system which normally overwrites its memory buffers and doesn't permanently record images. But as a result of the damage it retained pictures of the car's license plate and driver who was later identified and arrested thanks to this record of the incident.,Was it blind luck (pardon the expression) that I was wearing this vision-enhancing system at the time of the accident? Not at all: I have been designing building and wearing some form of this gear for more than 35 years. I have found these systems to be enormously empowering. For example when a car's headlights shine directly into my eyes at night I can still make out the driver's face clearly. That's because the computerized system combines multiple images taken with different exposures before displaying the results to me.,I've built dozens of these systems which improve my vision in multiple ways. Some versions can even take in other spectral bands. If the equipment includes a camera that is sensitive to long-wavelength infrared for example I can detect subtle heat signatures allowing me to see which seats in a lecture hall had just been vacated or which cars in a parking lot most recently had their engines switched off. Other versions enhance text making it easy to read signs that would otherwise be too far away to discern or that are printed in languages I don't know.,Believe me after you've used such eyewear for a while you don't want to give up all it offers. Wearing it however comes with a price. For one it marks me as a nerd. For another the early prototypes were hard to take on and off. These versions had an aluminum frame that wrapped tightly around the wearer's head requiring special tools to remove.,Because my computerized eyewear can augment the dark portions of what I'm viewing while diminishing the amount of light in the bright areas I say that it provides a "mediated" version of reality. I began using this phrasing long before the rise in popularity of the more widespread term "augmented reality" which usually refers to something less interesting: the overlay of text or graphics on top of your normal vision. That doesn't improve your eyesight. Indeed it often makes it worse by obscuring your view with a lot of visual clutter.,Photo: Richard Howard/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images Grand Day Out:  While a graduate student at MIT the author experimented with wearable computing systems including this rather ungainly 1996 arrangement. Click on image to enlarge.,For a long time computer-aided vision and augmented reality were rather obscure topics of interest only to a few corporate researchers academics and a small number of passionate hobbyists. Recently however augmented reality has captured the public consciousness. In particular Google has lately attracted enormous attention to its Project Glass an eyeglass-like smartphone with a wearable display. I suppose that's fine as far as it goes. But Google Glass is much less ambitious than the computer-mediated vision systems I constructed decades ago. What Google's involvement promises though is to popularize this kind of technology.,It's easy to see that coming: Wearable computing equipment which also includes such items as health monitors and helmet-cams is already close to a billion-dollar industry worldwide. And if Google's vigorous media campaign for its Project Glass is any indication of the company's commitment wearable computers with head-mounted cameras and displays are poised finally to become more than a geek-chic novelty.,So here then let me offer some wisdom accumulated over the past 35 years. The way I figure it thousands of people are about to experience some of the same weird sensations I first encountered decades ago. If I can prevent a few stumbles so much the better.,The idea of building something to improve vision first struck me during my childhood not long after my grandfather (an inveterate tinkerer) taught me to weld. Welders wear special goggles or masks to view their work and to protect their eyesight from the blindingly bright light often from an electric arc. Old-fashioned welding helmets use darkened glass for this. More modern ones use electronic shutters. Either way the person welding merely gets a uniformly filtered view. The arc still looks uncomfortably bright and the surrounding areas remain frustratingly dim.,This long-standing problem for welders got me thinking: Why not use video cameras displays and computers to modify your view in real time? And why not link these wearable computer systems to centralized base stations or to one another? That would make them that much more versatile.,I started exploring various ways to do this during my youth in the 1970s when most computers were the size of large rooms and wireless data networks were unheard of. The first versions I built sported separate transmitting and receiving antennas including rabbit ears which I'm sure looked positively ridiculous atop my head. But building a wearable general-purpose computer with wireless digital-communications capabilities was itself a feat. I was proud to have pulled that off and didn't really care what I looked like.,My late-1970s wearable computer systems evolved from something I first designed to assist photographers into units that featured text graphics video audio even radar capability by the early 1980s. As you can imagine these required me to carry quite a bit of gear. Nearly everybody around me thought I was totally loony to wear all that hardware strapped to my head and body. When I was out with it lots of people crossed the street to avoid me-including some rather unsavory-looking types who probably didn't want to be seen by someone wearing a camera and a bunch of radio antennas!,Why did I go to such extremes? Because I realized that the future of computing was as much about communications between people wearing computers as it was about performing colossal calculations. At the time most engineers working with computers considered that a crazy notion. Only after I went to MIT for graduate school in the early 1990s did some of the people around me begin to see the merits of wearable computing.,The technical challenges at the time were enormous. For example wireless data networks so ubiquitous now had yet to blossom. So I had to set up my own radio stations for data communications. The radio links I cobbled together in the late 1980s could transfer data at a then-blazing 56 kilobytes per second.,A few years before this I had returned to my original inspiration-better welding helmets-and built some that incorporated vision-enhancing technology. While welding with such a helmet I can discern the tip of the brilliant electrode even the shape of the electric arc while simultaneously seeing details of the surrounding areas. Even objects in the background which would normally be swallowed up in darkness are visible. These helmets exploit an image-processing technique I invented that is now commonly used to produce HDR (high-dynamic-range) photos. But these helmets apply the technique at a fast video rate and let the wearer view the stereoscopic output in real time.,Video: Raymond Lo Steve Mann Jason Huang Tao Ai SMOKE AND MIRRORS:  Realtime HDR (High Dynamic Range) video provides the ultimate in welding helmets.,Welding was only one of many early applications for my computer-aided vision systems but it's been influential in shaping how I've thought about this technology all along. Just as welders refer to their darkened glass in the singular I call my equipment "Digital Eye Glass" rather than "digital eyeglasses" even for the units I've built into what look like ordinary eyeglasses or sunglasses. That Google also uses the singular "Glass" to describe its new gizmo is probably no coincidence.,Photo: Richard Howard/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images Take Me Home: Each of these street views shows a portion of what is seen through the author's computerized vision system when it's running a way-finding application. Click on image to enlarge.,I have mixed feelings about the latest developments. On one hand it's immensely satisfying to see that the wider world now values wearable computer technology. On the other hand I worry that Google and certain other companies are neglecting some important lessons. Their design decisions could make it hard for many folks to use these systems. Worse poorly configured products might even damage some people's eyesight and set the movement back years.,My concern comes from direct experience. The very first wearable computer system I put together showed me real-time video on a helmet-mounted display. The camera was situated close to one eye but it didn't have quite the same viewpoint. The slight misalignment seemed unimportant at the time but it produced some strange and unpleasant results. And those troubling effects persisted long after I took the gear off. That's because my brain had adjusted to an unnatural view so it took a while to readjust to normal vision.,Research dating back more than a century helps explain this. In the 1890s the renowned psychologist George Stratton constructed special glasses that caused him to see the world upside down. The remarkable thing was that after a few days Stratton's brain adapted to his topsy-turvy worldview and he no longer saw the world upside down. You might guess that when he took the inverting glasses off he would start seeing things upside down again. He didn't. But his vision had what he called with Victorian charm "a bewildering air.",Through experimentation I've found that the required readjustment period is strangely shorter when my brain has adapted to a dramatic distortion say reversing things from left to right or turning them upside down. When the distortion is subtle-a slightly offset viewpoint for example-it takes less time to adapt but longer to recover.,The current prototypes of Google Glass position the camera well to the right side of the wearer's right eye. Were that system to overlay live video imagery from the camera on top of the user's view the very same problems would surely crop up. Perhaps Google is aware of this issue and purposely doesn't feed live video back to the user on the display. But who knows how Google Glass will evolve or what apps others will create for it?,tech,wearables, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx55kn0Lg1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLeo,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLet,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:145W9Fe,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLev,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLuJ, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Like literally everywhere? Think bigger than security cameras or everyone owning a video and photo enabled phone. Think twenty-four hours a day seven days a week. Recording every single moment of your life.,This scary speculation already has some people talking about the potential dangers of Google Glass as an "always on" ever-present camera. Because as much as the focus has been about what it means for the wearer it's also about who else is wearing them. "The key experiential question" asks Mark Hurst "isn't what it's like to wear them it's what it's like to be around someone else who is wearing them.",It's an important question and unless some kind of laws are enacted about public space and Glass if this kind of technology ever becomes ubiquitous being recorded all the time would become a very real possibility. Cameras everywhere.,Google Glass,We Are All Performers,So how would we consciously respond to this possible future? If we become more cognizant of the fact that we are always being watched how would our behavior be changed in the face of it? Even with friends and loved ones things could be used against us: recalled examined and dissected. It's an idea that's already been explored in Charlie Brooker's series Black Mirror in the episode "The Entire History of You" where a character fast forwards and rewinds through their life to the detriment of a relationship.,Of course our first reaction would be to act more carefully. To think more about everything we say instead of speaking off the cuff or naturally allowing a conversation to unfold. With the camera in the back of our minds we start thinking about what we should say and how we want it to be remembered. Or viewed. Or perceived. Not what we actually want to say. There's a kind of displacement of interaction where it's more important how we recall it in the future than how it sounds in the moment.,Everything becomes a performance. Cameras and videos make us perform. When we fear sharing too much there's a danger of no longer sharing at all. Or creating a distance between who we are and what we share. Just in case. So we act. We act to our friends to the strangers in public with their tiny little cameras. We become performers in a world of tiny little cameras.,But allow me to put blinders on for a moment to ignore the (very real) dangers of being recorded everywhere all the time.,Holy Motors' Vision of a Cinema in Real Time,One of the more fascinating if not all together baffling films that came out last year was the French film Holy Motors directed by Leos Carax. It follows Mr. Oscar (Denis Lavant) as he is driven around in a white limo to different public engagements. He dons different costumes and personalities where he performs for anyone from a public audience to a single person in an isolated room.,At once he is a panhandling old woman who no one pays any attention to. He is a gangster. A deformed old man who steals away a super model from a photo shoot. Each is like a short vignette a burst of narrative isolated from anything else but that single moment. As the film progresses these performances become more elaborate and absurd until the audience is forced to question how they are happening as well as for whom.,Holy Motors,What is so compelling about these performances is how orchestrated they are. There is something vaudevillian in his character-Mr Oscar the traveling one man act who plays different characters on a variety of stages entertaining the masses. Yet there is no longer any set stage. Not only there is there no stage but there is no screen. Sometimes there's hardly even an audience. There aren't even any cameras. Or are there?,The film is incredibly naturalistic in how it portrays the performances of not just Mr. Oscar but the other traveling performers as well. Everything feels so real. Sometimes to the point of death. It's all so seamlessly integrated into the "real world" of the film. Yet at one point there is this suggestion that this is not only some surreal film without narrative logic. On the contrary these performances point to a very specific vision of the future. A future where there are cameras everywhere. Real life blurs and suddenly everything is cinema.,Holy Motors,Cinema Ubiquitous,Andy Warhol thought in the future everyone would have their 15 minutes of fame. Francois Truffaut believed everyone would be running around with tiny little cameras filming everything. They were both only able to look so far into the future. And of course both were right in their forecast. However the micro-fame of video-enabled phones and YouTube is merely the precursor to a ubiquitous cinema in real time. What happens when everything becomes fodder to be recorded and recalled? Do we blur the distinction between real life and cinema? And how does that affect movie making? It's cinema verite run amok.,If everything is being recorded all of the time what does that say about performance in the public space? What does that say about the construction of cinema in general? If there is no longer a dividing line between real life and what could be a "movie" proper does real life become more like a film? Do the performances of Mr. Oscar infiltrate our world making us less aware of what is real or a performance? Everything becomes a movie in the making. Or even a movie happening right in front of our eyes. Actualizing itself in real time.,The Cloud as Database Narrative ,Another way to look at this is to consider the other component of Glass Project. That is the cloud Google will set up for which will be able to upload all photo and video we take with Glass. It becomes an infinite resource of raw material to watch edit combine etc. To generate a film from.,This is similar to Lev Manovich's Soft Cinema experiments in which he created a "movie" from separate streams playing different scenes and voiceovers mined from a database according to the author's rules. Software navigates the database and combines them to try to construct what the theorist calls a "database narrative." It is an investigation into how narrative can "emerge" naturally from a data collection. Imagine a similar kind of software trawling a database of an entire life's or community's or city's worth of video to construct a movie from it? What would the consequences be? How would we start seeing ourselves our interactions our entire lives if they were transformed into movies?,Still from one of Manovich's Soft Cinema experiments,Would our lives turn into some kind of permanent performance where we no longer understand the difference between fact and fiction? Where we no longer know if we are part of a play or if we are participating in a real life? What kind of cinema arises from this kind of confusion? Do we want to live in a world where everything is cinema?,architecture,art,tech,wearables, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx55mDZ0q1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:145W7gG,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:145W9VQ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrLuQ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:15YrN5U,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:145Wac4, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

A company called Otherlab is working toward a new kind of natural gas tank for vehicles based on an "intestinal" design. No it's not "digesting" the fuel any differently from today's natural gas-powered vehicles but it does wrap around the car's other "organs" much in the way that the body's digestive organs nestle into whatever space is available in the human trunk.,Essentially the idea is to have the fuel tank be a series of small high-pressure cylinders in the place of a single big cylinder. The small tubes would allow for conformability: car makers could shape the tanks to fit in any number of spaces and designs as opposed to the bulky needs of a standard natural gas tank. Otherlab was at the ARPA-E Innovation Summit last week where they made their case during the mildly crazy Future Energy pitch session; the company is an ARPA-E awardee and has received a relatively small $250 000 grant to develop the technology.,Otherlab says the conformable tanks could be made from either stainless steel or carbon fiber a difference that would change the weight and cost parameters. In general making natural gas a viable transportation fuel is limited by its energy density: it has about 30 percent less energy by volume than conventional gasoline does which so far has kept it to a niche part of the vehicle market. According to ARPA-E "if successful Otherlab's intestinal natural gas storage system would allow an increase in the storage density safety and space utilization and give automotive designers more freedom in vehicle design." They also point out that in theory at least natural gas vehicles produce 10 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional gas-powered vehicles.,According to the Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center natural gas currently powers only about 112 000 vehicles in the U.S. (though it's closer to 15 million around the world). As the natural gas boom continues in the U.S. thanks to Marcellus shale and other deposits that number is likely to go up and technologies like Otherlab's will probably be central to that growth.,http://bit.ly/145W7x9,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,alternative energy,hardware, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx55p4VUC1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In 1962 Mayor Robert Wagner of NYC predicted a culturally diverse economically viable global city for New York in 2012.  In 1988 Los Angeles Times Magazine gave its 25-year forecast for Los Angeles in 2013 predicting what a life for a family would be like filled with robots electric cars smart houses and an abundance of video-conferencing. Find out how their predictions fared after the break.,,The 1960s the decade in which Mayor Wagner was writing his predictions was a difficult time of social and economic decay for New York City.  A rise in a welfare burden and a declining population were both influenced by – and the results of – an increase in crime and failures in infrastructure that did not abate until the late 1970s.  It makes sense then that Wagner's words foretell a future for the city that has emerged out of this burdensome crisis to become a global city that would "reflect the spirit of individual enterprise of economic opportunity of social ferment and of cultural excitement" and that will "bespeak social pioneering progress and justice".  Wagner's future is marvelously optimistic.  He envisions New York City's influence stretching far beyond its five boroughs embracing the suburbs of Long Island and Westchester and even becoming a central node of the tri-state area that includes New Jersey and Connecticut.,His 2012 vision is fairly accurate.  New York City did rise out of the proverbial ashes beginning with the election of fiscally conservative mayor Ed Koch and has since become a global city.   "Much more than today" Wagner writes "NYC will serve for America and the world as a cultural intellectual and spiritual greenhouse".  While NYC still holds high its caliber as a global city Wagner certainly did not foresee the globalization of our industrial and manufacturing markets.  He just as easily missed how the development of countries like China and India have shifted our labor markets and our technological development.  In fact he predicted that industry and manufacturing would return in a grand scale to NYC to be close to regional rail lines and ports.  And while there has been an re-emergence in the last few decades of manufacturing in some of NYC's districts it does not shift the city's identity from being a financial center with its heart in Wall Street.,Wagner writes about a socially accepting city where "slums will be just a distant memory of a rot that afflicted the city long ago … [and] racial discrimination will be only a legend referred to as an illustration of a past shame".    He sees a city that embraces difference rather than conformity a city of endless variety a city where cultures do not blend into one but are celebrated and embraced.  Those ideals are still within the city's cross-hairs gradually approaching a more accepting and progressive city.,His vision of the physical manifestation of the city is that of a mixed-use master planning proposal that combines centers of culture recreation and education into areas integrated with housing.  These great complexes of neighborhoods or communities or possibly massive buildings are envisioned as rising high above any buildings in his contemporary city of 1962.  They do not occupy all the ground space and there is a vast freedom for plantings grasses sunlight and greenery.  Skyscrapers are living cities combined with light and air – as integral as stone glass or steel.  Was Wagner thinking of roof gardens terraces green facades energy code standards and LEED design guides?  And as for housing the critical component of healthy city life "will be designed and built to promote the social values of individual family and community life rather than laid out with the sole object of renting or selling at a particular price to a particular economic group or class".,By 2012 the problems of 1962 will have long been solved "but these solutions will have uncovered further and even more difficult problems whose eventual solution will in turn uncover still over problems."  He may have been optimistic in the resolution of the city's problems but he was critically realistic of the crises that the city the country and the world would continue to face.,The LA Times' comprehensive report takes an extensive look at the direction in which the social economic cultural and technological shifts will affect every day life in a bustling global city.  The 25-year forecast is much more concerned with outlining the technological advancements that would change the lives of LA's residents.  In an hour-by-hour look at the life of a small family Nicole Yorkin presents us with a vision of the city as taken from interviews with planners futurists scientists inventors and sociologists that study social trends.  In Yorkin's collaborated account the Morrow family has a smart home that automatically "turns itself on" in the morning to wake its residents.  Robots carry out menial tasks around the house helping children with their school work and offering overall support to the family.,LA is a renewed city with renovated infrastructure – clean sleak and bright.  Automobiles are still prevalent and clog the artieries of LA's infrastructural networks but alternatives to gas cars are found in induction lanes that cater to electric cars that slid along the roadways.  Cars are customizable GPS has taken over our navigation systems and cars can automatically respond to the road's conditions.  Yorkin acknowledges the environmental crises – the sun is getting hotter the ozone layer is still depleting and our health needs constant monitoring by our electrical appliances.,The 2013 of today may not be as advanced as 1988 expected it to be but some advancements are familiar: Google's self-driving car; the prevalence of GPS; electric cars; smart homes that monitor temperature and air quality and connect through wireless networks to emergency and security systems; and our constant attachment to electronic means of communication – to which Yorkin does not refer to as the internet but generally describes video-conferencing fiber-optics and e-mail.,In identifying the current problems that LA and metropolises around the work are facing Yorkin and the team of consultants are dead on.  They predicted rising population and demographic shifts that reflect a greater diversity of immigrants; a decline in manufacturing jobs and a rise in white-collar service industries to be filled by the immigrant populations.  They also warn that planning would need to begin early to address failures in the education systems address the needs of immigrant communities and address housing shortages and increasing density in the way people live as well as finding solutions for better resource management.,Both predictions look at the future with optimism.  Planners and designers are optimistic by nature – they envision a better future for cities of today and plan to succeed in strategies that improve upon the economic social and cultural conditions of today.  Wagner's view of NYC describes a very general idea of how fifty years would resolve the dismal crises faced by the city in the 1960s.  It looks at the city from a social and planning perspective taking into account the relationships of residents to their city.   In contrast the LA Times Magazine looked at the future as a technological utopia where technology is fully integrated into our everyday lives and challenges how we conduct our duties day to day.  Perhaps these two imaginings of the future could serve us in predicting what the next twenty-five fifty or a hundred years of our development holds by combining our social and cultural expectations with the rapidly advancing technology at our side.,Read Mayor Wagner's article here and the full LA Times Magazine article here.   ,Image Sources: Los Angeles Times Magazine April 3 1988 and The Gothamist,Predictions from the

The wearer places the heart rate monitor around the ribcage resting against the skin and close to the heart.

Search-engine giant Google has yet to figure out the answer.,However rival Microsoft is one step closer to finding the most viral information on Twitter thanks to its ViralSearch project that it unveiled last week. The software giant is trying to compile information to potentially create an algorithm that determines which topics will go viral at any given moment.,ViralSearch scans millions of articles videos status updates and photos and determines a virality rating for the hottest topics of the moment based on how it's shared on Twitter. ViralSearch identifies which users helped spread a certain story to their friends and determines the most influential users on a timeline that tracks how such a topic became viral.,While the general public won't get to test out ViralSearch anytime soon you can watch how this fascinating product works by checking out this demo below:,Start Making Your Videos More Viral With The TubeRank App,5 Things Every Creator Should Know About Making Their Videos Go 'Viral',http://bit.ly/XnGQRh, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,twitter,socialtech, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjx6j2rYTH1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The points are mapped out and turned into a plan for a 3D model which can then be produced by a 3D printer like the desktop version sold by MakerBot.,"The MakerBot Digitizer Desktop 3D Scanner is a great tool for archiving prototyping replicating and digitising prototypes models parts artifacts artwork sculptures clay figures jewellery" added Prettis. "If something gets broken you can just scan it and print it again.",MakerBot hopes to make the Digitizer available to consumers this autumn but in the meantime users can register their interest on the company's website.,Last year Prettis told Dezeen that cheap 3D printers could bring manufacturing back into the home. "Before the industrial revolution everybody did work at home; there was a cottage industry" he said. "Now we're bringing the factory back to the individual.",Earlier this year we reported on a desktop machine that grinds up waste plastic to make new filament for 3D printers and news that firearms enthusiasts in the US are sharing 3D print files for illicit items like weapons medical devices and drugs – see all news on 3D printing.,Dezeen was also at SXSW as part of Hackney House Austin a showcase of the most exciting creative and digital companies from the London borough.,(via: http://www.dezeen.com/2013/03/20/makerbot-digitizer-prototype-desktop-3d-scanner), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,3d printing,scanner,hardware,interface,tech, , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_MakerBot-reveals-prototype-desktop-3D-scanner_1a.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Four months ago the General Synod voted against legislation to introduce female bishops. Like his predecessor Rowan Williams Welby voted in favour of their introduction.,Another female member of the Anglican communion Evangeline Kanagasooriam will play an important part in the ceremony when she asks the archbishop formal questions about his role after he strikes the west door of the cathedral three times with his staff at the start of the service.,The African aspect of the ceremony is a nod to Welby's links with the continent in both his previous career as an oil executive and as a conflict negotiator during his time at Coventry cathedral.,The archbishop of Burundi in central Africa the Most Rev Bernard Ntahoturi will pronounce a blessing in French on the archbishop and African dancers will perform before the gospel is read at the service.,Other personal touches include Welby's choice of robes for the service. He will wear colourful vestments originally designed and made for the late bishop of Peterborough the Most Rev Ian Cundy who was his tutor at Cranmer Hall Durham where he trained in preparation for ordination between 1989 and 1992 after leaving the oil industry.,The archbishop will be asked to make the declaration of assent outlining his loyalty to the Church of England by the archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu. He will then be asked by Willis to swear an oath of faithfulness on the Canterbury gospels brought to Britain by St Augustine in 597.,The service will feature a newly commissioned anthem using the opening words of the Rule of St Benedict set to music by the composer Michael Berkeley. The ceremony coincides with the feast day of St Benedict of Monte Cassino a significant figure for both Canterbury cathedral which was a Benedictine monastery 1000 years ago and Welby who is an oblate of the Order of Benedict.,When the pomp and splendour is concluded the archbishop will begin the job of presiding over a communion that is greatly divided over the issue of female bishops and same-sex marriage.,In an interview with Channel 5 News that will have delighted proponents of women in the highest echelons of the church the archbishop said he believed there would be a female archbishop one day in spite of the Synod vote.,Pressed on the timing he said: "Oh I have no idea … when the right person turns up. But yes I think there certainly will.",On Thursday Welby addressed the question of same-sex marriage saying that some gay couples had loving and monogamous relationships of "stunning quality".,He said he backed the church's traditional view of marriage as the union of one man and one woman but he had witnessed the strength and profundity of same-sex love in the relationships of some of his friends.,"You see gay relationships that are just stunning in the quality of the relationship" he told the BBC adding that he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it".,It emerged that Welby sent a letter on Wednesday night to the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell offering to meet him face to face.,The invitation was in response to an open letter in which Tatchell accused Welby of being homophobic by opposing gay marriage and said some local Anglicans had colluded in persecution of gay people in Africa.,In his response the Times reported Welby thanked Tatchell for his "very thoughtful" letter and said the points he had made were "powerful".,(via Archbishop of Canterbury to be enthroned by a woman for first time | UK news | guardian.co.uk),women,religion, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mk0hesIH1H1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But are the activists' breasts obscuring the message?,,,,Link to video: Femen topless protest in Paris over Tunisian woman allegedly raped by police,One day last summer Inna Shevchenko went into a forest outside Kiev to learn how to use a chainsaw. The lumberjacks who were instructing her couldn't work out why she was so keen. "They thought I was just a crazy blonde" she says shaking her white curls. "I was acting like: 'Oh really?'" She affects a coy clueless demeanour. "'That's how you do it? Great!'",The next day she went to a hilltop overlooking Kiev and stripped to a pair of red denim shorts worn with heavy boots leather gloves and a mask to protect her eyes. The Pussy Riot verdict was due that day and in tribute to the Russian punk activists – and to mark her opposition to all religions – Inna proceeded to chop down a 13ft wooden cross that had been there since 2005. Despite her preparations it wasn't easy. "When I started to cut it I thought 'it's not possible to destroy it'" she says. But after seven minutes it fell and she posed against the stump for invited journalists. With "Free Riot" scrawled across her bare breasts she held out her arms to mirror the figure of Christ now lying on the ground.,Femen protester Inna Shevchenko cuts down a 13ft wooden cross overlooking Kiev in tribute to Russian punk activists Pussy Riot. Photograph: Sergey Dolzhenko/EPA,Death threats arrived instantly. She says there were official calls for her arrest and Russian TV reported that the cross was a memorial to the victims of Stalinism. Inna denies this but Ukrainian journalists repeated the claim and anger towards her sharpened. Men she suspected of being secret service agents immediately began milling outside her apartment and a few days later she was woken at 6am by the sound of her front door being kicked in. She escaped jumping through a back window then down from a first floor balcony and made her way to Warsaw with $50 a mobile phone and her passport. She feared jail if she returned to Kiev so some days later she travelled to France where women had expressed interest in joining Femen the feminist group she runs with three Ukrainian friends.,Femen's aims are straightforward broad and radical. A war on patriarchy on three fronts calling for an end to all religions dictatorships and the sex industry. The group has been offered a space in a rundown theatre in Paris as headquarters and it is here I meet Inna 24 at the start of a training session with 20 young Femen activists. She is giving instructions on the correct stance – feet apart firmly rooted aggressive. Femen warriors never smile she says they are not there to please anyone. The group has been protesting topless since 2010 using their bodies to attract attention to lure journalists and they have been roundly criticised by some people who accuse them of playing into sexist stereotypes.,In a room covered with posters and murals – Fuck Religion says one Go out! Undress! Win! says another – the activists stand in rows screaming slogans at each other. They're dressed in T-shirts and tracksuits occasionally stopping to swig bottled water. This is gym class for the revolution.,"Not a sex toy" they scream. Then "Poor because of you" and "In gay we trust". One by one they take to the middle of the room to show how they would behave at a protest. One new member shouts "Pope No More" before two other activists launch themselves at her. For a moment all three are mid-air then they hit the ground and start struggling in a blur. Inna has told them they must move constantly to avoid being covered; their slogan will be written across their bare chest and back and they need it to be seen. One woman fights hard still screaming occasionally breaking free running a few paces only to be brought down again with a brutal thwack. Finally Inna calls a halt and the woman stands up with blood running down her arm. Inna smiles grabs her hand and holds the injured limb aloft. There is clapping cheering congratulations.,As the activists start the next stage of training – situps press-ups running-while-screaming – journalists and cameramen swirl around. There is no attempt to hide the fact this session is being played out for the press. As women fight Inna comes up close to them in her denim hotpants hooded top and Converse boots instructing them to look at the camera. It doesn't matter how many people come to a protest she says – if there's one camera that's what they need to target to get their message out to millions.,On some level this is working. Each time Femen stages an action videos pop up on websites worldwide. But are their breasts obscuring their message? When I tell a friend I'm due to interview them he is fascinated by the idea of topless feminist warriors – but switches off as soon as I mention their arguments. I suspect there are long-time feminist activists who take one glance at their tactics and jaded by the use of women's bodies in art advertising commerce don't pause to hear what they're saying.,,Link to video: Euro 2012: Topless Femen activists in Ukraine plan football championship protests,Reading this on a mobile? Click here to watch,Their message can also get lost in the breadth and sprawl of their protests. While other groups focus on one or two issues Femen are everywhere. Over the past few years they have protested for gay rights in St Peter's Square during the Pope's weekly prayers; against the use of ultra-thin models at Milan fashion week; and during Euro 2012 inUkraine they grabbed the championship trophy in protest against the sex industry. In London last summer they smeared themselves in fake blood and accused the International Olympic Committee of supporting "bloody Islamist regimes"; at Davos in January they protested against male domination of the world economy. And in February they provoked both raised eyebrows and a few sniggers by launching themselves topless at Silvio Berlusconi.,Their campaigning is unified by one central aim: to use their breasts to expose corruption and inequality wherever they see it. "One of the main goals" says Inna "is to take the masks off people who wear them to show who they are and the level of fucking patriarchy in this world you know?" She says they also want to reclaim women's bodies for women. "A woman's naked body has always been the instrument of the patriarchy" she says "they use it in the sex industry the fashion industry advertising always in men's hands. We realised the key was to give the naked body back to its rightful owner to women and give a new interpretation of nudity … I'm proud of the fact that today naked women are not just posing on the cover of Playboy but can be at an action angry and can irritate people.",The group started in 2006 when founders Anna Hutsol Oksana Shachko and Alexandra Shevchenko (no relation to Inna) became friends in their home town in Ukraine. It was not long after the orange revolution in which Ukrainians had demonstrated for democracy and Alexandra 24 says they wanted to keep the revolutionary feeling going. They started a women's group and began organising against the sex industry. Sex tourism is a major problem in Ukraine and every woman is victimised as a result says Alexandra. "You'd walk down the street and foreigners men would come up to you ask how much touch you.",Inna joined the group in 2009 after meeting the other women on social media. In those early days they were just developing their views.Feminism was unpopular in Ukraine; saying you were a feminist was "something similar to saying you're an idiot you're crazy" says Inna. Alexandra says she used to believe the "image created by patriarchy where feminists are ugly women with moustaches who want to cut off men's penises". (They've played with this imagery themselves. Until recently their website featured a picture of a woman holding an enormous scythe in one hand a bloody scrotum in the other.),They embarked on long lively discussions about women's rights. "We're not based on 700 pages of doctrine" says Inna "instead we would come in and saying 'can you believe that fucker? He just touched my arse and said he wants to fuck me and he will pay me with a cocktail.' The discussion was very primitive and we became angry and wanted to express it so we started doing street performances.",These were clothed at first. They would go out with price tags hanging off them to protest against the sex industry for example; the group has long called for the Swedish approach to prostitution in which clients rather than sex workers are criminalised. They always had an interest in branding and initially wore all-pink outfits – some journalists called them the pink revolution. In 2010 in protest against the appointment of an all-male cabinet they dressed up as men then took off their suits to reveal women's clothing. Inna was working in the press office of the Kiev mayor at the time. As a result of the protest she was fired.,Femen activists protest outside Notre Dame in celebration of the resignation of Pope Benedict and the French parliament's decision to approve a draft law allowing same-sex marriage.

Presented by Martin Lupton and Sharon Stammers of renowned lighting consultancy Light Collective this interactive webinar will focus on how designers find inspiration.,Picasso once said that "inspiration does exist but it must find you working" and the Roman poet Ovid's insight was "the glow of inspiration warms us; it is a holy rapture". Martin and Sharon will discuss what inspires designers of today with a focus on light.,The word 'Inspiration' literally means to be "breathed upon". Throughout the history of mankind humans have believed that inspiration was a gift coming from the gods the muses or the divinity itself. Inspiration is the source of all creativity and innovation in artistic endeavor and its manifestation using the medium of light is truly fitting.

During our patent application trawling this week we fished up another possible application for Google's future-wear where the finished product might fuse together augmented reality (and wireless connectivity) to control objects around your house. The headwear will apparently using visual identification RFID infra-red Bluetooth and even QR codes as methods for recognizing controllable devices. Once your well-designed head-mounted display picks up a target it would then pull down information related to the object including a control interface. These "superimposed controls" would then hover over the real-life objects (which would need to be WiFi-connected or otherwise) with garage doors and refrigerators both referenced as possibilities (we've added sketches for both of these after the break). Whether you'd then adjust these white goods with your voice or otherwise is still an unknown - the predictably fuzzy-worded patent application doesn't quite touch on any… touch interfaces.,,,(via Google applies for another Glass patent thinks about controlling your garage door and fridge), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,hardware,wearables,google glass, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mk0j5fhOCF1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:opengarage.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But how about using gestures to create 3D models of any shape that you can use as Kinect avatars? No problem! That's exactly what Microsoft Research's Beijing team showed early this month at the company's TechFest 2013.,In the video above researcher Xiang Cao demoes their Kinect BodyAvatar which lets you build a 3D avatar of any shape you can imagine using your body as input. No need to master complex 3D modeling tools or programming though some artistic ability certainly helps. And granted the avatars still look like blobs of playdough but as the researchers refine the technology characters will start looking better.,But before you get too excited BodyAvatar didn't come out in Monday's Kinect for Windows SDK release. Let's hope Microsoft includes it in a future update but even if that doesn't happen users should be able to create their own BodyAvatar-like tool using some of Kinect's new capabilities.,In the video playlist below you can see some of the possibilities of the new SDK: Kinect's new gesture recognition interactions; Kinect Fusion's 3D modeling feature; and a demo of Kinect Fusion used for augmented reality. ,Ready for some hacking? Download the SDK here.,,http://bit.ly/11jS2F5, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,kinect,tech,augmented reality, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjz1xdlNbs1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:11ghCae, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Five top casting directors responded and it's clear from some of their answers that the simple answer is that they themselves are racists–sometimes it's actually that simple! Barbara Nicoli casting director for Burberry Marchesa Gucci Emilio Pucci Armani Privé & Saint Laurent was the most egregious taking an old worldview on not only body types but what is sexy:,"It's also true that for example Caucasians have a specific body type black girls have a specific body shape and Asian girls have a specific body shape. So I guess there are some collections where it's more perfect for an Asian body shape because they are more flat and less sexy in a way. Asians they are not curvy so to put an Asian [who's] very flat [with a] baby body shape in a show where normally the designer knows they love sexy beautiful curvy girls it's a bit of nonsense.",But as bad as she was casting director James Scully was amazing calling out some of the heaviest hitters in the industry:,"I feel the Dior cast is just so pointedly white that it feels deliberate. I watch that show and it bothers me - I almost can't even concentrate on the clothes because of the cast. And recently they're changing from a very diverse worldwide multicultural cast to just a very Germanic-looking white girl. If I were at Dior tomorrow there would be black girls in that show. I was also disappointed that Saint Laurent Louis Vuitton Chanel and kind of every other important fashion house - not one of them were racially diverse at all this season. My own personal stance is that the more diverse the better. A lot of my casts were indicative of that especially Jason Wu and Tom Ford.",This is why I laugh when old media "journalists" complain and kvetch from their front-row seats about fashion bloggers ruining fashion meanwhile oohing and ahhing about Chanel's globe for half of their so-called reviews and complaining about who was or wasn't invited for the rest.  The truth is if new media didn't come along someone would have had to invent because old media coverage of fashion was failing badly and the unfortunate part is its classist/racist world view still exists and continues to poison the fashion environment of today.,http://bit.ly/11jS2VA, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,cultures,fashion, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjz1xf12Xk1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The points are mapped out and turned into a plan for a 3D model which can then be produced by a 3D printer like the desktop version sold by MakerBot.,"The MakerBot Digitizer Desktop 3D Scanner is a great tool for archiving prototyping replicating and digitising prototypes models parts artifacts artwork sculptures clay figures jewellery" added Prettis. "If something gets broken you can just scan it and print it again.",MakerBot hopes to make the Digitizer available to consumers this autumn but in the meantime users can register their interest on the company's website.,Last year Prettis told Dezeen that cheap 3D printers could bring manufacturing back into the home. "Before the industrial revolution everybody did work at home; there was a cottage industry" he said. "Now we're bringing the factory back to the individual.",Earlier this year we reported on a desktop machine that grinds up waste plastic to make new filament for 3D printers and news that firearms enthusiasts in the US are sharing 3D print files for illicit items like weapons medical devices and drugs – see all news on 3D printing.,Dezeen was also at SXSW as part of Hackney House Austin a showcase of the most exciting creative and digital companies from the London borough,http://bit.ly/XZmrFF, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,dezeen,fabrication,makerculture,tech,emilie chalcraft, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjz1xhwOZK1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This article examines this methodological division before reviewing some of the debates that have figured in the philosophical literature of the last decade: whether emotion is a single kind of thing whether there are discrete categories of emotion and whether emotion is a form of perception. These questions have been addressed by both sides of the methodological divide and the integration of these two approaches would have clear benefits.,http://bit.ly/11ghEic, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,emotion,philosophy, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjz1xmrOyA1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Data increasingly influences companies' decision making processes but several speakers hit on the notion that people should be involved in big data storage and analysis.,It all starts with a human question. Before machines generate answers employees from many departments should feel empowered to ask good questions of data said John Sotham vice president of finance at BuildDirect.,Beyond questions humans need to decide which algorithms to employ and which data to use to answer questions said Scott Brave founder and chief technology officer of Baynote.,In data science machine use algorithms to make decisions with clean data for the sake of prediction and optimization said Sean Gurley chief technology officer of Quid. But in "data intelligence" humans "create change and shape the world we're in" using small sets of messy data he explained.,Sometimes algorithms don't bring the best results as well as people can. One website crowdsources identification of the top news to people as my colleague Kevin Tofel wrote. And at times it's wise to throw lots of people at big data challenges. With TopCoder there are competitions to discover the best software architecture algorithms and analytics said the company's chief technology officer Mike Lydon.,There was an exception to the man-and-machine rule. The software BeyondCore's software makes machines crunch all available variables to isolate the biggest profit generators. It displays charts and audibly tells you its findings.,It takes leadership,Becoming a data-driven company requires a human push said Paul Maritz chief strategist at EMC. "Change requires leadership" he said. "It requires people to understand what is happening and really get behind it and drive organizations to transform because none of us really like to change" he said. Only then can companies discover better ways to make money.,Meanwhile Amaya Souarez director of data center services at Microsoft saidthat lots of internal data doesn't automatically affect changes in strategy. "The data will help you in your discussions but it's not everything" she said. "It really does take a lot of personal interaction and commitment to that relationship" she said.,We want analytics and we want it now,Whether in Hadoop or in specialized databases our speakers showed why they want to see big data analytics to happen in real time.,Muddu Sudhakar vice president and general manager of the Pivotal Initiative's Cetas cloud and big data analytics platform called for "Hadoop high throughput low latency." And SQLstream CEO Damian Black said that 2013 "seems to be the year where it's all happening now. All Hadoop distributions are talking about streaming technology.",Ashok Srivastava chief data scientist at Verizon talked about what machines could do if they process data in real time: go through millions of new pictures users make on their cell phones and predict the health of a person or a machine based on changes over time. Similarly Maritz identified an opportunity telecommunications companies have yet to take advantage of: texting customers to apologize for a dropped call. "They can't even do that today let alone do more ambitious things on top of that" Maritz said.,Big data words to the wise,Executives IT administrators and others will likely discuss these themes in the coming months. A few statements from speakers also stand out:,"…What's really most intriguing is that you can be 100 percent guaranteed to be identified by simply your gait - how you walk." - Ira "Gus" Hunt chief technology officer of the CIA in a statement on the capabilities of a three-axis accelerometer,"Hadoop is hard - let's make no bones about it.

This collection focusing on the hand challenges this dichotomy offering theoretical and empirical perspectives on the interconnectedness and interdependence of the manual and mental.,,The contributors explore the possibility that the hand far from being the merely mechanical executor of preconceived mental plans possesses its own know-how enabling "enhanded" beings to navigate the natural social and cultural world without engaging propositional thought consciousness and deliberation.,,The contributors consider not only broad philosophical questions-ranging from the nature of embodiment enaction and the extended mind to the phenomenology of agency-but also such specific issues as touching grasping gesturing sociality and simulation. They show that the capacities of the hand include perception (on its own and in association with other modalities) action (extended) cognition social interaction and communication. Taken together their accounts offer a handbook of cutting-edge research exploring the ways that the manual shapes and reshapes the mental and creates conditions for embodied agents to act in the world.,Contributors Matteo Baccarini Andrew J.

The Machiguenga had traditionally been horticulturalists who lived in single-family thatch-roofed houses in small hamlets composed of clusters of extended families. For sustenance they relied on local game and produce from small-scale farming. They shared with their kin but rarely traded with outside groups.,While the setting was fairly typical for an anthropologist Henrich's research was not. Rather than practice traditional ethnography he decided to run a behavioral experiment that had been developed by economists. Henrich used a "game"-along the lines of the famous prisoner's dilemma-to see whether isolated cultures shared with the West the same basic instinct for fairness. In doing so Henrich expected to confirm one of the foundational assumptions underlying such experiments and indeed underpinning the entire fields of economics and psychology: that humans all share the same cognitive machinery-the same evolved rational and psychological hardwiring.,The test that Henrich introduced to the Machiguenga was called the ultimatum game. The rules are simple: in each game there are two players who remain anonymous to each other. The first player is given an amount of money say $100 and told that he has to offer some of the cash in an amount of his choosing to the other subject. The second player can accept or refuse the split. But there's a hitch: players know that if the recipient refuses the offer both leave empty-handed. North Americans who are the most common subjects for such experiments usually offer a 50-50 split when on the giving end. When on the receiving end they show an eagerness to punish the other player for uneven splits at their own expense. In short Americans show the tendency to be equitable with strangers-and to punish those who are not.,Among the Machiguenga word quickly spread of the young square-jawed visitor from America giving away money. The stakes Henrich used in the game with the Machiguenga were not insubstantial-roughly equivalent to the few days' wages they sometimes earned from episodic work with logging or oil companies. So Henrich had no problem finding volunteers. What he had great difficulty with however was explaining the rules as the game struck the Machiguenga as deeply odd.,When he began to run the game it became immediately clear that Machiguengan behavior was dramatically different from that of the average North American. To begin with the offers from the first player were much lower. In addition when on the receiving end of the game the Machiguenga rarely refused even the lowest possible amount. "It just seemed ridiculous to the Machiguenga that you would reject an offer of free money" says Henrich. "They just didn't understand why anyone would sacrifice money to punish someone who had the good luck of getting to play the other role in the game.",Joe Henrich was a graduate student when he tested the ultimatum game on the Machiguenga of Peru.,The potential implications of the unexpected results were quickly apparent to Henrich. He knew that a vast amount of scholarly literature in the social sciences-particularly in economics and psychology-relied on the ultimatum game and similar experiments. At the heart of most of that research was the implicit assumption that the results revealed evolved psychological traits common to all humans never mind that the test subjects were nearly always from the industrialized West. Henrich realized that if the Machiguenga results stood up and if similar differences could be measured across other populations this assumption of universality would have to be challenged.,Henrich had thought he would be adding a small branch to an established tree of knowledge. It turned out he was sawing at the very trunk. He began to wonder: What other certainties about "human nature" in social science research would need to be reconsidered when tested across diverse populations?,Henrich soon landed a grant from the MacArthur Foundation to take his fairness games on the road. With the help of a dozen other colleagues he led a study of 14 other small-scale societies in locales from Tanzania to Indonesia. Differences abounded in the behavior of both players in the ultimatum game. In no society did he find people who were purely selfish (that is who always offered the lowest amount and never refused a split) but average offers from place to place varied widely and in some societies-ones where gift-giving is heavily used to curry favor or gain allegiance-the first player would often make overly generous offers in excess of 60 percent and the second player would often reject them behaviors almost never observed among Americans.,The research established Henrich as an up-and-coming scholar. In 2004 he was given the U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for young scientists at the White House. But his work also made him a controversial figure. When he presented his research to the anthropology department at the University of British Columbia during a job interview a year later he recalls a hostile reception. Anthropology is the social science most interested in cultural differences but the young scholar's methods of using games and statistics to test and compare cultures with the West seemed heavy-handed and invasive to some. "Professors from the anthropology department suggested it was a bad thing that I was doing" Henrich remembers. "The word 'unethical' came up.",So instead of toeing the line he switched teams. A few well-placed people at the University of British Columbia saw great promise in Henrich's work and created a position for him split between the economics department and the psychology department. It was in the psychology department that he found two kindred spirits in Steven Heine and Ara Norenzayan. Together the three set about writing a paper that they hoped would fundamentally challenge the way social scientists thought about human behavior cognition and culture.,A MODERN LIBERAL ARTS education gives lots of lip service to the idea of cultural diversity. It's generally agreed that all of us see the world in ways that are sometimes socially and culturally constructed that pluralism is good and that ethnocentrism is bad. But beyond that the ideas get muddy. That we should welcome and celebrate people of all backgrounds seems obvious but the implied corollary-that people from different ethno-cultural origins have particular attributes that add spice to the body politic-becomes more problematic. To avoid stereotyping it is rarely stated bluntly just exactly what those culturally derived qualities might be. Challenge liberal arts graduates on their appreciation of cultural diversity and you'll often find them retreating to the anodyne notion that under the skin everyone is really alike.,If you take a broad look at the social science curriculum of the last few decades it becomes a little more clear why modern graduates are so unmoored. The last generation or two of undergraduates have largely been taught by a cohort of social scientists busily doing penance for the racism and Eurocentrism of their predecessors albeit in different ways. Many anthropologists took to the navel gazing of postmodernism and swore off attempts at rationality and science which were disparaged as weapons of cultural imperialism.,Economists and psychologists for their part did an end run around the issue with the convenient assumption that their job was to study the human mind stripped of culture. The human brain is genetically comparable around the globe it was agreed so human hardwiring for much behavior perception and cognition should be similarly universal. No need in that case to look beyond the convenient population of undergraduates for test subjects. A 2008 survey of the top six psychology journals dramatically shows how common that assumption was: more than 96 percent of the subjects tested in psychological studies from 2003 to 2007 were Westerners-with nearly 70 percent from the United States alone. Put another way: 96 percent of human subjects in these studies came from countries that represent only 12 percent of the world's population.,Henrich's work with the ultimatum game was an example of a small but growing countertrend in the social sciences one in which researchers look straight at the question of how deeply culture shapes human cognition. His new colleagues in the psychology department Heine and Norenzayan were also part of this trend. Heine focused on the different ways people in Western and Eastern cultures perceived the world reasoned and understood themselves in relationship to others. Norenzayan's research focused on the ways religious belief influenced bonding and behavior. The three began to compile examples of cross-cultural research that like Henrich's work with the Machiguenga challenged long-held assumptions of human psychological universality.,Some of that research went back a generation. It was in the 1960s for instance that researchers discovered that aspects of visual perception were different from place to place. One of the classics of the literature theMüller-Lyer illusion showed that where you grew up would determine to what degree you would fall prey to the illusion that these two lines are different in length:,Researchers found that Americans perceive the line with the ends feathered outward (B) as being longer than the line with the arrow tips (A). San foragers of the Kalahari on the other hand were more likely to see the lines as they are: equal in length. Subjects from more than a dozen cultures were tested and Americans were at the far end of the distribution-seeing the illusion more dramatically than all others.,More recently psychologists had challenged the universality of research done in the 1950s by pioneering social psychologist Solomon Asch. Asch had discovered that test subjects were often willing to make incorrect judgments on simple perception tests to conform with group pressure. When the test was performed across 17 societies however it turned out that group pressure had a range of influence. Americans were again at the far end of the scale in this case showing the least tendency to conform to group belief.,As Heine Norenzayan and Henrich furthered their search they began to find research suggesting wide cultural differences almost everywhere they looked: in spatial reasoning the way we infer the motivations of others categorization moral reasoning the boundaries between the self and others and other arenas. These differences they believed were not genetic. The distinct ways Americans and Machiguengans played the ultimatum game for instance wasn't because they had differently evolved brains. Rather Americans without fully realizing it were manifesting a psychological tendency shared with people in other industrialized countries that had been refined and handed down through thousands of generations in ever more complex market economies. When people are constantly doing business with strangers it helps when they have the desire to go out of their way (with a lawsuit a call to the Better Business Bureau or a bad Yelp review) when they feel cheated. Because Machiguengan culture had a different history their gut feeling about what was fair was distinctly their own. In the small-scale societies with a strong culture of gift-giving yet another conception of fairness prevailed. There generous financial offers were turned down because people's minds had been shaped by a cultural norm that taught them that the acceptance of generous gifts brought burdensome obligations. Our economies hadn't been shaped by our sense of fairness; it was the other way around.,The growing body of cross-cultural research that the three researchers were compiling suggested that the mind's capacity to mold itself to cultural and environmental settings was far greater than had been assumed.,,The most interesting thing about cultures may not be in the observable things they do-the rituals eating preferences codes of behavior and the like-but in the way they mold our most fundamental conscious and unconscious thinking and perception.,americana,psychology,culture, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mk0fw1aNb51s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:joehenrich-300x200.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:mullerlyercomparison3.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:rodandframe.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

However a new keyboard concept has more in common with so-called index typewriters-as seen in hipstomp's typewriter round-up-than these superficial keyboard treatments at least to the extent that it offers a more economic layout.,source,Specifically Minuum improves on the concept of a linear arrangement of letters: screen-based UI and predictive text allows for a QWERTY layout to be transposed into a single line of letters. (It's worth noting that index typewriters were initially developed as a less expensive more portable alternative to keyboard-based typewriters though they were reportedly slower than handwriting in most instances.),Minuum is a tiny one-dimensional keyboard that frees up screen space while allowing fast accurate typing. Current technology assumes that sticking a full typewriter into a touchscreen device is the best way to enter text giving us keyboards that are error-prone and cover up half the usable screen space (or more) on most smartphones and tablets.,Minuum on the other hand eliminates the visual clutter of archaic mobile keyboards by adapting the keyboard to a single dimension. What enables this minimalism is our specialized auto-correction algorithm that allows highly imprecise typing. This algorithm interprets in real time the difference between what you type and what you mean getting it right even if you miss every single letter.,The video is as they say a must-see:,Yes the last bit is cool but nota bene: it's currently an alpha-stage prototype and Will Walmsley & co. are currently seeking funding on IndieGoGo.

7,46422282696,2013-03-27 14:49:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/46422282696/thinking-about-employment,text,Thinking About Employment,In part 3 of this series I argued that the changes in employment are the main driver behind the massive rise in inequality in the US.  That inevitably brings out a number of responses for how to address inequality none of which I believe will actually work.  At the end of that post I already showed a graph that debunks the notion that this can be solved through better education (at least of the traditional variety).  Similarly we now have calls for better labor organizing and higher minimum wages. Unions played an important role during industrialization so why not now? As even Robert Reich concedes if there are too many people without a job it becomes very hard to organize those who have one. And even though I am sympathetic to an increased minimum wage as a short term measure in the long run it will only hasten the demise of jobs as machines do not qualify (ditto for healthcare).,What all of these old solutions have in common is that they are premised on the continued growth of traditional jobs. If we want to make progress we first have to abandon that notion and have to think about a world in which there are fewer and fewer traditional jobs. Here then are three proposed solutions aimed at such a world:,1. Encourage and support the creation of new marketplaces that support micro-entrepreneurship such as Etsy Airbnb Taskrabbit Kitchensurfing Sidecar Skillshare andShapeways to name just a few (including several USV investments).,2. Stimulate demand in areas of the economy that are mispriced or underpriced and hold significant employment potential for instance by taxing carbon and problematic food ingredients and providing prizes for space exploration and medical innovation.,3. Take measures aimed directly at inequality and its consequences such as unbundling healthcare from employment and changing the tax code to affect some level of redistribution.,Each of these will eventually get its own detailed treatment in a separate blog post.  But for now I want to provide some more justification for each and more importantly point out how they work together given the changes in employment.,Micro-entrepreneurship is exciting because it allows people to earn an income often with minimal need for capital. Many (but not all) of these marketplaces are aimed at providing unique products or experiences or otherwise ad hoc tasks that will not easily be substituted by machines any time soon. So from a regulatory perspective we should be encouraging the growth of these marketplaces and the creation of new ones. Instead we are seeing a fair bit of hasty action such as the cease and desist orders against Lyft and Sidecar that could harm the development of these marketplaces.,The second part of the approach is likely to be more controversial. But I firmly believe that it is the central role of government to deal with externalities. And we have a bunch that are not properly addressed today that could create significant net new employment. When people protest a carbon tax by pointing to jobs that would go away they fail to point to the new jobs that would get created. In fact a carbon tax would mostly hit industries that are heavily substituting machines for humans whereas it would benefit efforts such as reforestation that are labor intensive. The same goes for processed foods compared to local farming and farm-to-table. I strongly favor approaches such as taxes and prizes where the government just sets the framework and lets private activity unfold over having this activity be part of the government itself. In fact this is a strong complement to the micro-entrepreneurship. For instance taxing highly processed foods while simultaneously fostering farm-to-table marketplaces (e.g. Farmigo and Good Eggs) will push economic activity from capital intensive to labor intensive which is what we need. Similarly posting prizes for medical innovation and space exploration will help foster collaboration in emerging research networks such as Research Gate.,Some of the likely criticism of both of these recommendations is that people cannot earn enough money via micro-entrepreneurship and that taxing carbon and processed foods will make staples more expensive thus compounding the inequality problem. Which is exactly why we need to attack inequality and its consequences more directly. In fact all indirect approaches which make labor more expensive are the exact opposite of what we need in a world which is substituting away from labor. Direct approaches aimed at making healthcare accessible and affordable (one of the major issues with inequality) and redistribution through the tax code don't have that problem.,The goal for today's post was to get these three pillars of what I think of as the "new new deal" out there. I will provide more meat on each of these in subsequent posts.  But I want to address one other immediate question as to how we can afford all of this. Leaving aside for a moment that we cannot afford the alternative which ultimately heads towards massive social unrest I am proposing new revenue sources for government.  I also believe that by shifting more activity into new and emerging marketplaces we can actually reduce some costly government programs. In fact re-inventing how we tax and allocate budgets to avoid the silliness that is the Washington's fiscal cliff could and should be a fourth component.,What I am most hoping for with this post is to move the debate past the old solutions and past the old divisions towards a different set of approaches that do not fall along existing party lines.  All of the proposals above really are aimed at moving us away from the hierarchical organization of production which is dominated by a substitution of capital for labor towards apeer economy and society.,(via: http://continuations.com/post/37110837581/thinking-about-employment-part-4), , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,employment,gig economy,collaborative consumption,entrepreneurship,tech,share economy,peer-to-peer, , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Though the Great Plains aren't the geography most commonly associated with trendy sharing-economy apps RelayRides likes to make the point that its service makes as much sense in a rural area as in a city.,Rent-by-the-hour car-sharing companies like Zipcar need the more frequent usage that comes with urban density to cover the cost of maintaining a fleet Webb says. Peer-to-peer car-sharing doesn't have that issue since the cars' owners would be paying for the upkeep of their vehicles anyway.,At the moment RelayRides says vehicles in its network are available in 1366 cities and towns across the country (see above). Though it won't disclose an exact number the company says thousands of cars are being rented to tens of thousands of drivers.,As with other digitally driven sharing-economy services such as Uber for taxis or AirBnb for lodging RelayRides runs on the realization that there's money to be made in idleness. According to the company most cars sit unused about 92 percent of the time. And while it sits your car is doing one thing: depreciating.,RelayRides' pitch to car owners is that now you can make your car earn its keep. The average monthly cost of car ownership is $233 per month. The average car owner who rents his or her vehicle out through RelayRides meanwhile brings in an average of $250 per month. That's the equivalent of renting your car out just a few hours per week.,RelayRides depends on a fairly stringent screening process to weed out bad drivers from taking your car into a ditch. In addition to having cars in all 50 states the company is also linked up to all 50 state DMVs. Too many moving violations and you can't rent using RelayRides.,The cars themselves are screened by the drivers themselves who leave feedback and star-ratings after they're done driving much as they would rate a seller after buying something on eBay. And this isn't surprising: RelayRides CEO Andre Haddad once worked as head of product for eBay's multi-billion-dollar global marketplace.,That experience in managing one of the world's largest platforms for peer-to-peer buying and selling makes Haddad a good fit for RelayRides which he says is all about changing the way people think about their relationships to cars. Instead of a car being something to be owned a car is something to used.,"The way people use cars hasn't really changed much in the past century" Haddad says. RelayRides wants to be that change.,"It's a business model innovation" Haddad says. "It's the same car. We're not changing car technology. We're changing the way people use cars.",(via Make Your Car Pay for Itself by Renting It to Someone Else | Wired Business | Wired.com), , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,share economy,automotive,peer-to-peer, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mkbqn4MgRR1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Across the country new multidisciplinary spaces for people to learn experiment and make are popping up creating a new surge of jobs with them.,Obama's State of the Union Address this year was a steady dopamine drip for me: "We have cleared away the rubble of crisis … making America a magnet for manufacturing … a once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything." And be-still-my-heart: "we are finally poised to control our own energy future." He might have well described the Emerald City as far as I was concerned.,I think it's important to try and understand what exactly these "state-of-the art labs" or "manufacturing hubs" will be like and the direct role they play in employing more Americans while also making manufacturing processes smarter.,,The aim of these hubs is to put smart entrepreneurial people together with advanced manufacturing technology to come up with applications for that technology. Those applications will reduce waste in manufacturing processes which will mean that U.S. manufacturers can charge less for their services. With new technology comes the need for newly skilled workers to wield it properly. So it's a smart growth strategy: reduce the bottom line and increase profit; take profit and reinvest it in the company's growth (i.e. adding employees).,It's easy to imagine rows and rows of MakerBots humming away with workers waiting patiently for the parts and assemblies to come "hot off the press" but the reality looksmore like this. Those are pictures from the pilot National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute in Youngstown Ohio that President Obama mentioned in his speech (Full disclosure: my employer Autodesk is involved in the pilot). As you can see the machine tools are a mix of additive manufacturing technologies (like 3-D printing and laser sintering) and machine tools that you'd find in factories today that cut stamp and assemble parts together. The solutions coming out of the lab will probably be workflows comprised of elements from both.,We've looked at the theory and the technology pieces but how will that induce growth? Another hub is a venture aptly named New Lab. The site developed by New York-based real estate and design firm Macro Sea is an 84000-square-foot space in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. It is the consummate public-private partnership backed by Speaker Christine Quinn the NYC Council the Empire State Development Corporation Regional Council Mayor Bloomberg and others.,It is slated to be kind of a non-denominational MIT Media Lab where cross-pollination between green manufacturing startups R&D teams academia designers technologists and digital fabricators will run rampant.,There has been such great demand from groups wanting to get in that Macro Sea decided not to wait for the retrofit to be completed and has opened a beta space in an adjacent building where they are hosting tenants. The beta program will illuminate the best ways for New Lab to incubate these groups and give them excellent physical spaces in state-of-the-art co-working labs war rooms libraries and fabrication shops.,,The beta group contains some impressive members including: Within Lab DNI (Lowline Solar Collector) Hypersonic and Terreform ONE all of whom plan to join academic tenants like Columbia University Applied Building Sciences in the larger space when it opens. In this beta group alone there is a brain trust that can grow furniture light underground areas utilize technology to identify optimized forms for 3-D printing and explore digitally fabricated spaces designed to morph over time.  The space will likely be one of the most prominent examples of resilient architecture in New York City. The cavernous space once a repair shop for Navy ships experienced flooding during Hurricane Sandy. Macro Sea like most sane entities expects megastorms to be a regular occurrence. They are tackling this strategically by bringing all electrical wires from above and installing a hoist that can be used to easily move equipment on the first floor to the second floor mezzanine at the next big hurricane warning. They're also thinking about resiliency by creating slab flooring that can be wiped in the event of a surge. The last important defining characteristic of these hubs is their ability to create jobs. How will they induce job creation?  Alex Escamilla senior project director at Macro Sea explains: "We estimate 332 permanent jobs will come from New Lab on top of the 72 temporary construction jobs. The beauty of being in the Brooklyn Navy Yard is that as these businesses grow there is plenty of space for them to expand and hire more workers."   While this may be a small number of jobs in the grand scheme of the overall jobs crisis it's an example of how innovation creativity and pursuing new areas of industry can be instrumental in the creation of not only jobs but important advances in the application of technology. Hopefully we'll start to see new labs crop up across the country and deliver the promise of Obama's State of the Union. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,sustainable manufacturing,micro-industry, , , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-slide-750-building-wb-28-09.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-slide-750-building-wb-28-01.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-slide-750-building-wb-28-02.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-slide-750-building-wb-28-04.png,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-inline-8477038750-f1669c6d34-b.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:server:routes:tumblr-air:photos:1681586-inline-750-building-wb-28-07.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Kennedy declared to this Chamber that "the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress…It is my task" he said "to report the State of the Union – to improve it is the task of us all."  ,Tonight thanks to the grit and determination of the American people there is much progress to report.  After a decade of grinding war our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.  After years of grueling recession our businesses have created over six million new jobs.  We buy more American cars than we have in five years and less foreign oil than we have in twenty.  Our housing market is healing our stock market is rebounding and consumers patients and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. ,Together we have cleared away the rubble of crisis and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.,But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.  Our economy is adding jobs – but too many people still can't find full-time employment.  Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs – but for more than a decade wages and incomes have barely budged.  ,It is our generation's task then to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth – a rising thriving middle class. ,It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities you can get ahead no matter where you come from what you look like or who you love.,It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise rewards individual initiative and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.,The American people don't expect government to solve every problem.  They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.  But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party.  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.  For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.,Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget – decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.,Over the last few years both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion – mostly through spending cuts but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.  As a result we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.    ,Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is how? ,In 2011 Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.  These sudden harsh arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.  They'd devastate priorities like education energy and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That's why Democrats Republicans business leaders and economists have already said that these cuts known here in Washington as "the sequester" are a really bad idea.  ,Now some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.  ,That idea is even worse.  Yes the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms – otherwise our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.  ,But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful.  We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers cops and firefighters.  Most Americans – Democrats Republicans and Independents – understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction with spending cuts and revenue and with everybody doing their fair share.   And that's the approach I offer tonight.  ,On Medicare I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.  Already the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  The reforms I'm proposing go even further.  We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital – they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep – but we must keep the promises we've already made.  ,To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected.  After all why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?  How is that fair?  How does that promote growth?,Now is our best chance for bipartisan comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America.  That's what tax reform can deliver.  That's what we can do together., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,tech,obama,3d printing,manufacturing, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
