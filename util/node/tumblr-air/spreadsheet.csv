The empirical basis for inferring bricks’ intentions is well established comprising building traditions that have evolved over millennia. For newer materials the chance of moving from laboratories to construction sites can be a crapshoot. The successful ones not only capture markets but transform behavior. The most promising approaches materials specialists agree emphasize integration rather than isolation. “We don (a href=”http://bit.ly/115up31”Continue reading./a) http://bit.ly/110bKSg,The Architect&39;s Newspaper - News Channel,architecture,material,t,(author unknown), , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjt85qKAS71s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

For one thing the Armory Show’s Focus section with energetic crowds and sales wasn’t this year’s sideshow. “People seem to be buying a lot in the young section” said art advisor Wendy Cromwell. Twenty minutes into the fair’s preview Focus galleries were already reporting strong sales. “The first thing we sold was this Paul Gabrielli box to John Waters” said Invisible-Exports co-owner Benjamin Tischer pointing to a chained-up cardboard box that went for $6500. The gallery also sold two of the artist’s wooden soap-dish sculptures. Next door meanwhile Monique Meloche had already sold Joel Ross and Jason Kreps’s photograph of a desolate Illinois landscape for $7500 plus a neon work by collective Type A and an installation of bronze-plated shoes by Kendell Carter. Connersmith gallery was offering Lincoln Schatz’s photographs of American innovators for $5000 each but a collector had placed the entire set of 89 on hold. Across the way Gagosian’s booth of Warhol paintings brought star power to this subsection of the fair. Despite the buzz at Focus big-ticket sales were few and far between. Modestly priced works however like 32-year-old TM Davy’s lush paintings of candles at Eleven Rivington were selling fast. The gallery sold all 20 paintings in three hours the works priced between $2500 and $3500. Kavi Gupta Gallery sold two ink-stained canvases by James Krone for $6000 each as well as a paint-splattered fabric work by Angel Otero for $35000. The lower price points suggest a shift in the Armory Show’s collector base according to art advisors. With the arrival of Frieze New York which returns to Randall’s Island for its sophomore edition in May blue-chip buyers may not feel the need to shop at the piers. Still said Cromwell “collectors who are buying new artists are all here.” Major international dealers most of which are also participating in Frieze New York this spring did manage to secure a handful of marquee sales. “Let’s just say we’ll be rehanging tomorrow” dealer Sean Kelly said. Lisson sold a maroon fiberglass disk by Anish Kapoor for $455350 and a grisaille canvas covered with sandpaper by Allora & Calzadilla for $125000. Victoria Miro sold a glistening blue and black web painting by Yayoi Kusama for $400000. Sprüth Magers sold three works by George Condo — two works on paper for $45000 and one painting for $250000 — as well as a shaggy yarn sculpture by Rosemarie Trockel for $228000. Two of three grainy soft-focused video installations of flower bouquets by Diana Thater also sold at David Zwirner. Priced at $150000 both went to private collectors. That one of them has an art foundation pleased Thater who was at the booth. “I don’t like my work disappearing” she said. “I like it to go to institutions and museums so it can be seen.” Smaller New York galleries noted the fair marked a welcome return to business as usual. “We’re back to being dealers as opposed to hurricane victims” said Ed Winkleman.

Athletes are measured on a sensitive track to gauge the direction their foot travels whether its forward or back left or right and how it moves; 100 sensors are placed on an insert inside the shoe to measure pressure at different points; and a motion capture system — like the ones used for video games and movies — adds stride and broader movement into the equation. Based on the biomechanical data custom spike plates the part of the shoe that actually connects with the ground are created. The new process was first reported by Wired magazine on Wednesday. Right now this process is only for New Balance elite sponsored athletes but said Katherine Petrecca the company’s business manager of studio innovation that will change with time. “The technology is early and our implementation is still really in a very early phase but you can envision as the technology improves and capacity increases — and cost comes down — the audience who will benefit from customisation will just grow and grow and grow. This will get down eventually to the casual athlete.” Some top runners helped in the development: 1500-meter World Champion gold medalist Jenny Barringer Simpson 2012 US Olympian Kim Conley 2012 British Olympian Barbara Parker and All-American runner Jack Bolas. A bonus? The addition of the athlete’s signature to the plate as if they were signing an autograph noted Chris Wawrousek studio innovation lead designer. It wasn’t singularly demand or technology that drove the development of the technique said Wawrousek studio innovation lead designer it was the idea that the industry is at a watershed moment thanks to both demand and technology. “It feels like a new industrial revolution in some ways. We’re no longer limited by scale to produce a product and customization can be totally practical” he said. The athletes themselves were another factor. “It almost never happens that you put an athlete in a shoe and they don’t have some comment about it” Wawrousek added. “In this case we can have an athlete say ‘This one particular spike is in the wrong place. Can you move it?’ In this case we can say ‘Yes!”  Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

The three-wheeled two-passenger vehicle comprises 40 large 3D-printed thermoplastic parts compared to the hundreds of parts found in a normal car. The URBEE 2 is being developed by RedEye On Demand and its parent company 3D printer maker Stratasys in collaboration with KOR EcoLogic. So far in its development 3D printing has largely been used to produce unique or customisable items in single editions or small runs but the arrival of the URBEE 2 suggests it could also be applied to mass production on a huge scale. “A future where 3D printers build cars may not be far off after all” said Jim Bartel vice president of RedEye On Demand. “URBEE 2 shows the manufacturing world that anything really is possible. There are few design challenges additive manufacturing capabilities can’t solve.” Once it’s road-ready the designers plan to drive URBEE 2 from San Francisco to New York on just 45 litres (10 gallons) of biofuel such as ethanol. The car is a follow-up to KOR EcoLogic’s 3D-printed URBEE prototype which was launched in 2010.  We’ve been closely following the rise of 3D printing reporting on plans to 3D-print a plastic house and a pen that sketches out 3D shapes in mid-air – see all 3D printing news. Other cars we’ve published lately include a car with light-up wings by fashion designer Jeremy Scott and Audi’s shape-shifting OLED headlights – see all car design. Here’s the press releases from RedEye On Demand: At RedEye On Demand 3D Printed Cars Edge Closer to Production Road-ready URBEE 2 will set new precedent for building fuel-efficient vehicles Minneapolis March 7 2013 – RedEye On Demand a rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturing service and its parent company Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ: SSYS) today announce a collaboration with KOR EcoLogic to produce URBEE 2 the first road-ready fuel-efficient car built using 3D printing or additive manufacturing technologies. Targeted to hit the road in two years URBEE 2 represents a significant milestone in the world of traditional assembly-line manufacturing. “A future where 3D printers build cars may not be far off after all” said Jim Bartel Stratasys vice president of RedEye On Demand. “Jim Kor and his team at KOR EcoLogic had a vision for a more fuel-efficient car that would change how the world approaches manufacturing and today we’re achieving it. URBEE 2 shows the manufacturing world that anythingreally is possible. There are few design challenges additive manufacturing capabilities can’t solve.” The KOR EcoLogic team will fully design URBEE 2 in CAD files sending them to RedEye On Demand for building through Stratasys’ Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. This unique process applies thermoplastics in layers from the bottom up yielding parts that are durable precise and repeatable. The finished two-passenger vehicle will comprise 40 large intricate 3D-printed parts compared to hundreds of parts in the average car. The strong lightweight vehicle will be designed to go 70 mph on the freeway using a biofuel like 100 percent ethanol. The goal is for URBEE 2 to drive from San Francisco to New York City on only 10 gallons of fuel setting a new world record. “As a mechanical engineer I’ve always believed we could use technology to help us solve some of society’s greatest challenges like minimizing our dependence on oil and reducing ozone emissions. How cool is it that American manufacturing can evolve to tackle these challenges head-on? Our team is excited to launch URBEE 2 putting a next-generation vehicle on the road that will eventually be sold to the public” said Jim Kor president and senior designer for Winnipeg-based KOR EcoLogic. URBEE 2 which stands for urban electric follows in the tracks of its conceptual predecessor Urbee 1. Produced in 2011 as a partnership between KOR EcoLogic Stratasys and RedEye On Demand Urbee 1 proved that 3D printing could in fact produce large strong parts that meet accurate specifications of a car body. URBEE 2 will take the basic concepts of Urbee 1 to a higher level including features like a fully functioning heater windshield wipers and mirrors. “With the Urbee 1 project I learned that product design is nearly unencumbered by considerations on how parts can be made with digital manufacturing. That liberation is incredibly powerful and holds a lot of potential for the future of manufacturing” said Kor. http://bit.ly/10jMtWC,Dezeen,3D Printing,tech,Emilie Chalcraft, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrxndPU3Q1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_RedEye-On-Demand-3D-printed-car_2.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

That includes diversity of all life experiences including gender. Women were some of the first programmers and continue to make a major impact on the programming world today. We think it’s important to highlight the great work women are doing in computer science to help provide role models for young women thinking about careers in computing. Tomorrow is International Women’s Day and as one of our contributions to the celebration we’re proud to support Voices Global Conference presented by Global Tech Women. As part of this 24-hour live streamed event Google will provide more than a dozen hours of free talks featuring women working in computer science beginning today. To access the full schedule and our ongoing broadcasts see our section on the Voices website which will be updated throughout the day. The Voices Global Conference is the brainchild of Global Tech Women’s founder Deanna Kosaraju who also started India’s Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing in 2010 with grant support from Google. The India conferences which provide a forum for women to share their professional and research work in computing have grown rapidly with more than 800 attendees in 2012. So when Deanna proposed this global 24-hour streamed conference we knew it was a great opportunity to help women and other audiences around the world learn more and get inspired about the contributions women are making to technology and computer science. Our sessions will feature a range of material from new episodes of the Women Techmakers series and interviews with women leaders like the head of Lexity India Mani Abrol to discussions focusing on technologies like Google Compute Engine. For a sneak peek of the type of content we’ll be providing check out Pavni’s story below produced in conjunction with PBS’ MAKERS series. I’ve provided advice to many young people in India interested in studying computer science and pursuing their own dreams—so Pavni’s tenacity coupled with the encouragement and support she received from her father resonated with me. We’re excited to share her story and others like it alongside technical conversations and discussions on women in technology as part of this conference.  I hope you’ll join us for our sessions—and in the meantime you can learn more about our efforts to support women at Google and beyond.Posted by Beryl Nelson Software Engineering Managerhttp://bit.ly/Xt0MFG,The Official Google Blog,tech,women in tech,Emily Wood, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrw8w5BDm1s75lgto1_r1_500.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:13J697s, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They’re a fashion label whose founders come from a background in interaction designer and architecture which has given them a unqiue perspective when it comes to how they designs their garments. Their approach is to utilize the hive mind of the internet along with web applications to allow consumers to create their own designs using software. Coming across like a Google Chrome experiment their DIY little black dress D.dress allows users to create their own version of this wardrobe staple by drawing it on a model using triangulated forms. Advancing on this theme of crowdsourcing the design process is their latest project CONSTRVCT which allows users to create their own clothes using an online app with a 3D interface. “When you’re building something like this do you build the platform or do you build the object?” asks Huang. “We choose to build the platform because of the creative force of the community.” CONSTRVCT With this new computational shared design process Huang notes how it combines the experimental creativity of the catwalk with the practical issues (like sizing etc.) of the high street—allowing users access to a third path that breaks down the previous barriers and points to a future where anyone can create their own collection in the same way anyone can make their own music or video using readily available digital tools.

L-R: Christophe Lemaire APC Lanvin Celine Chalayan  Theme: The New Normal Usually the home of wildly extravagant fashion experimentation Paris served up some delightfully perfected takes on the tried and true for fall 2013. Take note: It seems like the denim pendulum may be swinging the way of stove pipe rigid indigos in the near future  L-R: Julien David Rick Owens Balenciaga Comme Des Garcons Chalayan  Theme: Exquisite Tatters Are couture-worthy finishes intentionally falling to bits? It’s the concept that many Parisian designers dabbled in this season yielding pieces that wed the words “rags” and “riches” in a new way.  L-R: Veronique Branquinho Barbara Bui Ann Demeulemeester Lanvin Rick Owens  Theme: Metro-Western There’s a new sheriff in town: The “Urban Cowboy”–or “Cowgirl” as the case may be–rides again for fall 2013. This time she’s taken a dark and brooding path that calls for dramatic street-sweeping coats and rodeo-tailored tops.  L-R: Balmain Rue du Mail Undercover Nicolas Andreas Taralis Stella McCartney  Color: Purple’s Reign Sidestepping dicey retro references to Tina Yothers on Family Ties and a certain children’s entertainer/dinosaur that shall remain nameless purple emerged as a chromatic fascination for a host of Paris designers this season.  L-R: Gareth Pugh Christian Dior Mugler Christian Wijnants Sharon Wauchob  Color: Ebony and Ivory Polar opposites unite for fall 2013 as black and white pairings brought a classically graphic punch to the Paris collections. We’re excited to invest in the perfect white shirt (as though we don’t own several already) in order to interpret the look come September.  L-R: Undercover Givenchy Kenzo Dion Lee Lanvin  Print + Pattern: Surreal So Real Mix one part Schiaparelli with one part Dali and a dash of Walt Disney and you’ll be on the same print wavelength as many of the designers we saw in Paris. Whether you love them or hate them one thing is for sure: These prints will have you talking.  L-R: Nina Ricci Carven Celine Damir Doma Sharon Wauchob  Detail: Fit to Be Tied Call it “straitjacket-chic” or “twisted sister-tailored” self-tie detailing of all sorts added complex interest to Paris’s collections. Phoebe Philo’s “arm parties” at Celine will definitely be editorial home-runs; we are dying to see who takes the plunge on purchasing one of her multi-sleeved creations.  L-R: Veronique Branquinho Julien David Louis Vuitton Christophe Lemaire Rochas  Key Item: While You Were Sleeping Marc Jacobs wasn’t the only designer loving the idea of rolling out of bed and heading to work in PJs (though he may be the only one that practiced what he preached). Slumber-time inspired sets and jumpsuits cut in sumptuous satins (the alliteration just happened we swear!) showed up within several collections threatening to make effortlessly chic slobs out of all of us come fall.  L-R: Roland Mouret Stella McCartney Valentino Dries Van Noten Chanel  Key Item: La Petite Robe Noire It’s time again for that perfectly quirky LBD complete with a cut-out a feather trim or a nutty hemline to seal the deal. Tons of DIY potential here kids…  L-R: Mugler Giambattista Valli Carven Celine Nicolas Andreas Taralis  Key Item: Fabergé-figure Coat Egg-shaped outerwear featuring rounded shoulders and ovular volume was a big story within the collections. We like the idea of being able to wear our fave motorcycle jacket under such generously cut macaron-colored coats. http://bit.ly/WOqmqg,Fashionista,fashion,Kibwe Chase-Marshall, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjruuwY8VI1s75lgto1_250.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:newnormal-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:exqtatters-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:metrowestern-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:purplesreign-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:ebonyivory-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:surrealsoreal-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:fittobetied-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:whileyouweresleeping-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:robenoire-640x420.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:figurecoat-640x420.jpg, , , , , , , , , ,

The 60-year-old model and daughter of Ingrid Bergman charmed us with her candid talk about plastic surgery (“Is it the new foot binding?”) and about how her life has changed in the industry as she’s gotten older. (Rossellini famously claimed she lost her Lancome contract in 1996 for being “too old.”) Sadly Isabella wasn’t at our screening — we would have fangirled out for sure — but luckily the Italian model and actress has a new set of ads to give us our fix. Rossellini 60 stars in a new Bulgari campaign for her latest collection of Isabella Rossellini for Bulgari bags as reported by Women’s Wear Daily. The model looks stunning in the spots shot by Annie Leibovitz who alsophotographed Rossellini for that famous portrait with David Lynch back in 1986.Here she does the same black-dress-halfway-off-the-shoulder thing but this time instead of a man covered in a turtleneck she brandishes a gorgeous red handbag one of her signature pieces that will be available for fall and spring. Can we place our order? Rossellini’s ads will appear in the September issue of Vanity Fair. Psst Isabella: we won’t tell Lancome (and… Burt’s Bees?) that you’ve switched fashion teams.,fashion,age, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrvv0zdgb1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

From left: Aimé Guerlain the creator of Jicky introduced in 1889; a rendering of the perfume stations in “The Art of Scent” exhibition; and Ernest Beaux creator of Chanel No. 5 which made its debut in 1921.  By CAROL KINO Published: November 15 2012  The way we think of a perfume today often has more to do with how it’s sold than what it actually smells like. Whether it’s Lady Gaga’s Fame or the early-20th-century classic Chanel No. 5 now promoted by Brad Pitt the focus is typically on the shape of the bottle the color of the packaging and the images of romance — or celebrity — constructed by a marketing department. But there is another way to appreciate fragrance: as a pure art form born near the turn of the 20th century like Modernism itself. That at least is the vision of Chandler Burr the curator in charge of the two-year-old department of olfactory art at the Museum of Arts and Design.  “The fundamental goal of the department” Mr. Burr said during a recent interview at his office “is placing scent as an artistic medium alongside painting sculpture and music.” For however “brilliant” or “extraordinary” the greatest scents may be he added “they’re not recognized as works of art and the artists who create them are not recognized as artists.” Mr. Burr who wrote the 2003 book “The Emperor of Scent” andused to write about fragrances for The New York Times aims to change that when he opens his first show at the museum on Tuesday. Called “The Art of Scent 1889-2012” (through Feb. 24) the exhibition will use 12 fragrances to chart the evolution of modern perfumery starting with Aimé Guerlain’s Jicky (1889) among the first to blend synthetic with natural ingredients and continuing through Chanel No. 5 (1921) created by the great perfumer Ernest Beaux and generally considered the first modern fragrance to contemporary scents like Olivier Cresp’s cotton candy-scented Angel (1992) which Mr. Burr described as “a work of beautiful overt Surrealism.” Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the show is its spare installation designed by the architects Diller Scofidio & Renfro. While most scent exhibitions — there have been a smattering over the years though rarely at mainstream museums — rely on displays of packaging or raw ingredients visitors to this one will enter a minimalistic white cube whose walls dispense puffs of fragrance. The labels projected on the walls will name each scent as well as the perfumer who created it (until fairly recently their names were known only within the trade). And the wall texts will describe each scent in terms typically reserved for visual art and architecture like Modernist abstract or Brutalist. “To a degree it’s a problem of language” Mr. Burr said. “We have not had anything other than a marketing language applied to these works.” Using terminology associated with established art forms he added “will allow us to understand these works and their aesthetics and what they communicate and why they exist.” When asked to speak more straightforwardly about what particular fragrances smell like — citrus say or sandalwood — Mr. Burr became inflamed. “I am completely opposed to this idiotic reductionism of works of olfactory art to their raw materials which is as stupid as reducing a Frank Gehry building to the kind of metal the kind of wood and the kind of glass that he used” Mr. Burr proclaimed. The olfactory art department came about after Mr. Burr proposed the concept to Holly Hotchner the director of the museum. It struck Ms. Hotchner that fragrance was analogous to photography which even into the 1970s was seen as “a very different venture from art” she said. She also saw fragrance as a perfect fit with the overall program of the museum which has explored some fairly radical approaches to art and design. Previous shows have focused on subjects like handmade bicycles and contemporary art made from organic materials like chicken bones insects or spices; visitors are often encouraged to smell or touch examples of the materials used. “People who know us kind of expect that when they come here — to learn something new to see something new” Ms. Hotchner said. “This will definitely be in the vein of experiencing something new.” After Mr. Burr joined the museum he and Ms. Hotchner began figuring out how to translate an extraordinarily evanescent art form — one that is typically encountered on the skin or lingering in the air — into the visually oriented context of a museum. That challenge appealed to Liz Diller a partner in Diller Scofidio & Renfro the firm best known for the High Line in Chelsea and the Lincoln Center redevelopment project. “The real excitement and lure” of designing the scent exhibition she said was in figuring out “how to make this work in a place that privileges vision as the master sense.” The firm had worked on experimental projects like the Blur Buildingat the 2002 Swiss National Expo a pavilion on Lake Neuchâtel that was essentially made of mist created by high-pressure water jets and the 2010 exhibition “How Wine Became Modern” at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art where visitors could inhale the scents of wine from open carafes. This time “we didn’t want to show perfume bottles we didn’t want to focus on videos of the scent artists talking we didn’t want it to be a kind of exploratorium” Ms. Diller said. “We really wanted to suck everything out of that place except the scent.” The solution they arrived at involved creating a gallery with 12 gently curved indentations in its walls. Hidden behind each is a scent diffusion machine: a visitor who leans into the curve will set off an electronic eye causing the machine to release a burst of fragrance calibrated to stay in place for four seconds without spreading across the room. (Made by the German company Scentcommunication the machines are typically used in industry trade shows; this is the first time organizers believe that they have been used in a museum.) There will also be a “more social” space as Ms. Diller put it where visitors can dip strips of blotter paper into petri dishes filled with the 12 fragrances in the show and to experience various stages in the development of a 13th Sophia Grojsman’s 1990 Trésor via peel-and-sniff cards. But for the most part she added her firm’s focus was on making a “wall full of machinery and effects look like there’s almost nothing there.” As for Ms. Hotchner and Mr. Burr their biggest challenge may have been corralling the international cosmetics companies and scent makers whose aid they sought in financing the department and putting together its first show. “This was a totally new idea for them that scents would be presented without marketing and packaging” Ms. Hotchner said adding that “it was a longer journey than we’d imagined.” Nonetheless they stuck to their guns refusing to offer guarantees of inclusion in shows — or placement in the gift shop — to companies that gave them help. (The first to come on board was Estée Lauder a longtime supporter of the museum.) Of the 11 companies and groups that are now listed as sponsors of the show eight have scents on display; they are listed on the wall labels as lenders.  (In this context lending really means giving: throughout the run lenders will donate essential oils for the scent diffusion machines — about enough to produce nearly 600 100-milliliter bottles of eau de toilette.) The only fragrances sold in the museum will be packaged with the catalog which  combines essays by Mr. Burr with small pharmaceutical-style bottles of each fragrance. (The cost is likely to be about $250.) As for those little-known perfumers they seem somewhat divided about the idea of becoming “known as great artists” as Mr. Burr put it. “To me it’s a very thrilling moment” said Carlos Benaïm a master perfumer for International Flavors and Fragrance in New York who was one of the creators of Prada Amber (2004) which is featured in the show. Mr. Benaïm who is responsible for some of the world’s top-selling scents including White Diamonds (1991) and Polo (1978)  also observed that “there has been a big evolution of the function of the creative person” since he started out in the industry 45 years ago. Back then perfumers were effectively ghostwriters while now as the show demonstrates he said “we are coming into the public view as artists on our own with our own personalities our own styles our own expression.” But Daniela Andrier the Parisian perfumer behind Untitled (2010) the first fragrance commissioned by the Belgian designer Martin Margiela and the newest work in the show sees things somewhat differently. She appreciates the idea of regarding perfume as an art form she said especially today when it is “under a major threat” from the pressures of commercialization and allergy regulations which increasingly limit the use  of natural materials. And by putting it in a museum she added Mr. Burr “is putting it under protection in a way.” But when it comes to her own role Ms. Andrier who works for the Swiss scent maker Givaudan still has a hard time with the concept. “I do think it takes a creative soul to make fragrances” she said “but I don’t think it makes us artists.” Nonetheless she continued “museums are filled with things that I don’t see as art.” And in an era where some of the most successful artists are those who are good at marketing she added “I do think Untitled is more interesting than a lot of the stuff you find in museums.” ,scent,exhibition,art, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrvjswaEy1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
45527855958,2013-03-16 21:24:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45527855958/multi-museum-multi-curator-tumblr-alexandra,photo, , ,Multi-Museum-Multi-Curator Tumblr Alexandra Lange: To create a multi-museum multi-curator Tumblr I planned a kind of curatorial game: Show Me What You’ve Got. To create metamuseum.tumblr.com a multi-museum multi-curator Tumblr @MADMuseum I saw it as a kind of curatorial game: Show Me What You&rsquo;ve Got. I’ve written several times about Tumblr as a platform for everyday interactions with museums archives and other collections of visual and historical artifacts (see here hereand most recently here in “Shopping With Sandro”). One of the benefits of museum Tumblrs and similar projects like the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum’s Object of the Day is the potential they have to surface items in the collection that have not been exhibited for years to hold them up next to more current and popular objects and see what connections happen. The Tumblr can be like a sketch of curation cheaper and less consequential than an exhibit; or deeper and wonkier on a particular even personal topic.When I was asked by Jake Yuzna and Dan Rubinstein to contribute ideas to the Museum of Arts and Design’s spring public series on the theme After the Museum a Tumblr was the first thing that sprang to mind. One of the aspects that intrigues me about the platform is the potential for lightness visual jokes and play. I decided to structure my Tumblr as a curatorial game of free association (and potentially one-upmanship). As the editor I set the themes 13 in total. Then I sent them out to curators of design architecture decorative arts and crafts collections across the United States essentially saying Show me what you’ve got. I defined design in the broadest terms in hopes of getting some unusual neighbors and I put the start date at 1850 where the architectural historians like to begin modernism. Marking sampler (Dresden Germany 1834) Embroidered on cotton. (courtesy Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum)In December I invited more than two dozen curators geographically dispersed to participate. By January 13 had agreed to send me five to ten objects from their collections in response to my themes. I must to thank all of the participants for fitting this project into their busy schedules and for being good sports: Zoe Ryan Art Institute of Chicago; Rachel Delphia Carnegie Museum of Art; Ellen Lupton Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum; Darrin Alfred Denver Art Museum; Mel Buchanan Milwaukee Art Museum; Jennifer Komar Olivarez Minneapolis Institute of Arts; Lyndsay Bratton Museum of Arts and Design; Sarah Margolis-Pineo Museum of Contemporary Craft; Emily Zilber Museum of Fine Arts Boston; Paola Antonelli and Barbara Eldredge Museum of Modern Art; Lena Vigna Racine Art Museum; Andrew Blauvelt Walker Art Center; and Ivana Rodriguez The Wolfsonian-FIU. Sophie May and Reply coordinated and designed the Tumblr at MAD. The curator’s texts make fascinating mini-histories and take many different approaches to defining an object. Opening the emails with the images attached was like a virtual Christmas morning (if you are a collections nerd).John McQueen Untitled 1994. Tulip poplar bark and plastic rivets. (courtesy Racine Art Museum)The result launched this week at metamuseum.tumblr.com. If you are on Tumblr please follow for 13 weeks of fascinating objects seven days a week. If you’re not on Tumblr I would suggest checking in on weekends when you’ll be able to see all the objects that illustrate each theme. @MADMuseum will also be tweeting the items daily. I won’t reveal all of the themes since discovery is part of the fun but I will say they run from Alphabet to Year One (something from the year of the museum’s founding). The images in this post are all responses to the Alphabet theme and give a good sense of the project’s diversity. At its end I hope the Tumblr will serve as a discussion-provoking survey of modern and contemporary design and will foster other posts (in visual or verbal form) on what we might learn from this collaborative experiment. Coincidentally the editors of art blog Hyperallergic are sponsoring The World’s First Tumblr Art Symposium on March 9 in Brooklyn. I would attend if I could. Leading up to it they have published a series of essays analyzing the intersection of art artists museums and Tumblr posted here.George C. Blickensderfer (American 1850-1917) Model 6 portable typewriter c. 1906 aluminum steel. (courtesyMinneapolis Institute of Arts)Also this week I reviewed a tiny new exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art “Plain or Fancy? Restraint and Exuberance in the Decorative Arts” for the Culture Desk blog at the New Yorker. Drawn from the Met’s European decorative arts collections this is the kind of exhibition that would work very well on Tumblr. The Met decided instead to put it on Twitter @PlainorFancy and there are a pair of iPads in the gallery for viewers to vote up or down on their taste for severity v. ostentation. (The results are not encouraging so far.) As I say in the review “I tried really I did” to like some of the things on the fancy side. And I learned an onomatopoeic new vocabulary word “prunt.” http://bit.ly/15betJe,tech,tumblr, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjruusnNui1s75lgto1_r1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:37728-marking_sampler_1981_525.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:37728-Alphabet_525.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:37728-Alphabet_Blickensderfer_525.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Using depth sensors and motion-mapping technology to investigate how people actually use their bathroom space bathroom brand Ideal Standarddiscovered that younger people spent on average 1 minute and 39 seconds longer than on the loo than their parents’ generation. The study which was presented this week at the ISH bathroom trade fair in Frankfurt looked at households from Germany France Italy and the UK varying from single-occupancy homes to families spanning multiple generations. Brits were found to have the quickest morning routine at 19 minutes 42 seconds – eight minutes faster than the Germans Italians and French who all average just over 27 minutes. UK households also use their bath the least with the French taking the most baths – half of those with a separate bath in their house use it at least once a day. The researchers also found that while 40% of people say they want a new bathroom it usually isn’t a bigger space they’re after but a better use of their existing space. Ideal Standard then asked British designer Robin Levien to create a “profile bathroom” for each of the households in the study combining the brand’s existing products to create new spaces that meet the needs of each household. This week we featured a shower with rain and fog settings that makes you feel like you’re washing outdoors – see all bathrooms on Dezeen. Here’s the full press release from Ideal Standard: What really goes on in the bathroom - Ideal Standard reveals findings of spy-in-the bathroom study For most people it’s a sanctuary from which even partners and family members are excluded. And yet for two weeks in February nineteen people in four countries agreed to let Ideal Standard Europe’s leading bathroom specialist track their every brush splash and flush in the name of research. In a first for bathroom research prototype motion mapping technology was installed in bathrooms across Europe to monitor bathroom behaviours. By adapting depth sensors to provide accurate 3D tracking of the human body and using two sensors in each bathroom Ideal Standard has been able to build a detailed picture of how people actually use their bathroom space. It’s a tale of neglected baths and bidets conflicting bathroom etiquette and maddening illogically arranged bathroom suites. The findings supplemented with quantitative data gathered from 4000 people will be revealed today at ISH 2013 in Frankfurt. Behind the data lie some fascinating glimpses into family life: the parents who seek refuge from their families with long baths and showers; the bathrooms that double up as laundries and dressing rooms; the flatmates forced to do their ablutions in unison. According to the findings 40% of us crave a new bathroom but interestingly for the most part it’s not a bigger space that we lust after; just a space that better meets our needs. “We started with a hypothesis that in many homes the bathroom is not used as well as it could be” said Kerris Bright Chief Marketing Officer of Ideal Standard International. “The findings seem to confirm what we suspected. Renovating a bathroom often starts with excitement and ends in disappointment. It’s hard to know where to start and harder to see past the limitations of the room.” The publication of the study coincides with the launch of Ideal Standard’s new marketing campaign; A Beautiful Use of Space. The campaign features a series of abstract bathroom spaces – a far cry from the usual imagery of scented candles and infinity baths looking out onto lush forests – to capture the different needs a bathroom meets in a day; invigoration transformation relaxation and play. Families from Germany France Italy and the UK participated in the study representing a variety of households from single occupancy to multi-generational homes. From Rotherham to Wuppertal; from Milan to Paris the families agreed to let their every movement in the bathroom be captured analysed and scrutinised by Ideal Standard researchers. The results of the quantitative and qualitative studies will be analysed over the coming months but already some fascinating insights are emerging which will help Ideal Standard and its design teams innovate for the future. “We conducted the study because uniquely our product range spans every aspect of bathroom design” said Kerris Bright. “We’ve always tried to understand how a bathroom works in totality and to think about the ergonomics of the bathroom to help our customers get the most out of their bathroom experience.” The findings are published today in a paper entitled Bathroom Behaviours; how to optimise bathroom space for modern households. “The bathroom is a unique space in the home” said Dr John Curran social anthropologist and author of the paper. “It stands out from other rooms in the home because it has to meet an array of needs. “It’s a room that transforms us from one state of mind to another and can therefore mark different personas we have throughout the day. These transformational characteristics mean that the bathroom is embedded in everyday rituals – rituals that help define who we are. “However the design of bathrooms – the storage fittings aesthetic and the variation in size – means that meeting all the needs of household members becomes a challenge all the more so in light of rapid demographic change which is seeing a rise in single person all adult and multi-generational households and households with older people.” For each of the bathrooms in the motion mapping study Ideal Standard has set about creating a ‘profile bathroom’ based on insights gathered. Each profile bathroom can be considered a useful starting point when designing bathrooms for different needs. The profile bathrooms have been developed by Robin Levien an award winning designer. Robin used Ideal Standard’s full product offering – the core Connect range the elegance of Softmood the minimalism of Strada and an extended range of water and energy efficient showers and fittings – to create spaces which meet the needs of the different types of household in the study. “It was important to have a multifunctional approach to the products we recommended in each of the bathrooms” said Robin. “Based on the household make up coupled with their individual preferences we selected a range of Ideal Standard products to offer a complete solution. To borrow from Le Corbusier’s famous quote ‘a bathroom is a machine for living in’ so we made them more liveable.” Editors’ notes 1 Some of the findings Parental retreat For parents the bathroom represents something of a refuge from family life. Our quantitative data shows that adults in family homes spend longer in the bathroom than average and take longer baths especially when the children in the house are under five. This was borne out by the behaviour of the parents in our motion mapping study who took longer to clean preen and prepare themselves than others in the study. Competing uses And yet whilst the bathroom can represent a place of retreat for parents this is the group least likely to be satisfied with their current bathroom set up. They struggle with the multiple sometimes conflicting uses the space demands – spa pharmacy laundry children’s playroom – and they are most likely to complain about clutter and lack of storage space. Again the quantitative data is supported by qualitative evidence. The participants in our motion mapping study who made best use of their space were couples and singles. The bathroom reclaimed Older people living alone or as a couple were most likely to be satisfied with their bathroom suggesting a sense of reclaimed space once children leave home. This group is able to create the largest storage space in their bathroom despite the fact that the space needs to serve fewer people than average. Adults only For people living in all adult homes – for example students sharing a flat or families where the children have returned after university – the bathroom is most likely to be viewed as a purely functional space. This is the group that tends to shun long baths and relies instead on the shower. The bathroom is most likely to double up as a laundry in these homes. No one individual holds dominion in these households which means there is often pressure to do what you need to do and get out. Do people use bidets? Bidets are very common in some parts of Europe and much less common in others. For years bathroom designers have wondered how frequently bidets are actually used. Our motion mapping study offers only a limited glimpse into this intimate but important question. In one household the bidet was scarcely used at all during the experiment whilst in another it was used daily. Our quantitative data suggests that outside of Italy – where bidets are considered an essential part of everyday bathroom routine – the facility is used very infrequently. The French and the Brits in particular seldom use theirs. Hot showers and cold baths A composite analysis of all the homes in our motion mapping study suggests that baths are underused and that more and more people rely on showers for their daily bathing routine. It may be that we are coming to a time when having a bath in the main family bathroom is no longer a non-negotiable essential. Have couples got it right? More than any other group couples are able to keep their bathroom spaces tidy and ordered. This may be a result of having the incentive of keeping the bathroom space tidy for the other person while not having the disruption that comes with family life – a perfect storm! A Beautiful Use Of Space? Based on the motion mapping study Ideal Standard Non executive design director Robin Levien proposes a degree of reconfiguration in all cases suggesting that a great many bathrooms are sub-optimally designed. Who spends longest in the bathroom? • The average person’s morning bathroom routine (shower toilet basin) takes 25m59s. • Brits have by far the quickest morning routine at 19m42s – nearly eight minutes faster than the Germans (27m35s) Italians (27m33s) and French (27m11s) • Women spend an average of 1m13s longer on the standard bathroom routine than men • There’s nothing to choose between the genders when it comes to bathing – of those who have a bath only 36% are choosing it over a shower as part of the daily routine • Under 30s are spending an average 1m39s longer on the toilet than over 55s – and they’re much more likely to be checking Facebook than reading a book • UK households use their baths the least – 33% of those with a separate bath use it just a couple of times a week • The French are the biggest bath fans – 50% of those with a separate bath use it at least once a day • 35% of French households have no toilet in the main bathroom while 95% of Italians have a bidet • 18-30s want a bathroom space they can share but showers for two get less appealing when respondents hit their 30s – by the time they hit their 50s the bathroom is a purely private space • Germans are the least happy with their current bathrooms while the Brits tend to be the happiest. http://bit.ly/YxUgwu,Dezeen,architecture,Emilie Chalcraft, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrthzuMVF1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But soft robots are also getting closer to becoming what are in effect mechanically agile medical devices that can “monitor your insides” in the words of Sangbae Kim assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT as reprinted by Popular Science sneaking around inside your body like an earthworm.  The so-called “meshworm” is exactly that: a robotic “worm” made from layered wire mesh that uses “nickel-titanium alloy for muscles.” The application of a high temperature “shortens the wire tightens the spring’s coil and squeezes that body segment.” Thus “when a segment contracts the one behind it stretches out and the robot inches forward. The tendon also has muscles attached so the robot can turn left or right.”  The result is the oddly grotesque and somewhat phallic creeping machine you see in the short video above. The idea is that this could be used for medical diagnosis or vascular surgery.  However the architectural or broadly spatial uses of this technology are also worth considering including the potential for monumentally scaled-up versions of the meshworm capable of assisting human or material transport through the built environment—a kind of peristaltic package-delivery tube that could replace the much-discussed pneumatic tubes of an earlier urban era. Like something out of a David Cronenberg film the city would have a kind of giant bowel-infrastructure distributing waste material from point to point. More interestingly though this new class of soft robots and meshworms could quickly assume their roles as architectural explorers in their own right burrowing through collapsed buildings passing beneath or around doors even being taken up by the more ambitious burglars and tactical operations teams of the world.  Or for example earlier this month in the cave state of Kentucky the annual “Cave City Hamfest” explored how to bring radio transmission deep underground. This was “accomplished by placing handheld (relay capable) walkie-talkies or relay boxes along a cave passage.” “After the inital debugging phase we demonstrated the ability to simply walk the cave until data was lost and then backing up a few feet for a solid link. Then placing a radio on a convenient rock and continuing.” Taking this as our cue we could simply wire-up a team of meshworms with radio repeaters and send a small crawling team of spelunking robots far ahead of us into caves where no human body can fit; they would crawl until they lose a signal move back a few feet to re-establish a secure feed and then the next one squirms dutifully forward.  You’ve thus built a mobile semi-autonomous deep-earth radio network made from repurposed medical devices—equal parts cave-mapping expedition and subterranean pirate radio station—opening up whole new realms of underground exploration (and tactical media). http://bit.ly/WsYvtt,BLDGBLOG,robot,tech, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrsseMa1r1s75lgto1_r1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

And it’s not in “filters” in the current sense of the word. I’ve noticed an interesting difference in the way people use the word “editing” when they talk about photography. Most people use “editing” to refer to the process of modifying a single image to make it look different which might include cropping saturation contrast and increasingly using a preset filter to condense a complicated set of editing procedures. And if you look at a large set of pictures from a photographer each image will often be edited quite differently to whatever look worked best for that photo. But when I talk to professional photographers they use “editing” to refer to the process of selecting a certain set of images to present in a series to show a body of work which is often used to tell a story or deliver an overarching message. Usually they use a consistent composition vantage point and framing and vary the subject in order to focus people on the message of the series. And therein lies the future of filters. Semil Shah: The tricky thing here is that only in hindsight do filters or boards or exploding pictures make sense. But why do they make sense? It’s not the filters or the boards or the exploding pictures themselves: it’s what they accomplish as easy-to-use tools to make our photos better. Consider Vine: Vine also skips the filters. That would just add an extra step to making a video clip that doesn’t add much instant value to it. Instead Vine lets you string multiple shots together in a way that’s just as simple as Instagram’s filters. Editing it seems is the “filters of video”–the value-add that video can do quickly and easily that other visual media can’t. Exactly. Filters win because they are easy simple ways to make our photos better. Vine’s editing wins over other video apps because it makes the process of creating a video incredibly easy. We have an abundance of complex rich powerful tools to edit photos and many of us app swap between a number of apps to reach the effects we want but when push comes to shove we use whatever is the easiest way to create and share what we want people to see. Video has struggled to get the same adoption at scale for a pretty simple issue: the variability of quality after the click. Scan a photo you get the whole picture. Scan a thumbnail of a slice of a video and you get a guess of what’s behind the click. Any indecision or lack of commitment to see beyond the slice and we don’t click. Vine wins because it standardizes the format the aspect ratio and even the length of the video. Less variation in the editing reduces the variation behind the click lowers the decision process about clicking play and standardizes how the content is presented. The focus is on the subject and the message. The standardization effect is important. In Instagram’s case the mobile phone-only usecase standardized square format limited set of filters and editing tools made it super simple to edit and share images. Fewer decisions. Easier to scan and consume. Lower variability in format and structure. The focus is on the subject and the message. A bit like memes. Fake art real messages. So what’s the next part of the photography stack to be standardized? Any manual human process that requires knowledge time and experience to get right. Let’s start with composition. Composition Filters can help make a photo more interesting but great composition is the base of a great image. Composing a good image is hard. It takes a good eye and while an eye can be developed it takes time and effort. There’s a reason why photography instruction courses manuals and photowalks are big businesses and great revenue sources for many photographers: learning to take a good photo takes time. But it’s also something that’s hard to productize. It’s hard to program a camera to help someone take a better picture in real time. To get someone to think about the rule of thirds and change where they position the subject (grid lines are a start of course). It’s hard to get someone to think about where they are positioning the subject and pay attention to the broader frame (the square format helps a bit with this). It’s hard to get someone to crouch down choose a different angle move their feet all to find a more interesting viewpoint. And that’s why I think we’ll soon see apps that productize the photographic eye and standardize composition. Editing We’re undergone a revolution in how and why we share images. The next value-add will be in helping us figure out what to do with these images. “Editing” will move from editing individual images and toward editing series of images or in an easier-to-understand sense towardstorytelling. If you look through the popular images on Instagram it can be a shock: very few of them are traditionally “good” images. But they’re great messages. And sometimes they’re great stories. But as individual images they’re still only snippets of stories. In my mind most of the complaints about the rise of democratized photography stem from visual information overload and the quest for stories not snippets. Snippets are perfectly fine - fleeting momentary humanizing visual communication can be powerful - but acknowledge the difference. “It’s not information overload. It’s Filter Failure.” is based on the challenge that our systems for managing information abundance are perpetually swamped by the growth of information and I believe it applies to visual imagery as well. With umpteen images of the same place or event or message already existing and being created how do we find a way to make a different meaningful even popular image? How do we filter and find the “best” images? That’s where stories come in. The best images have a deeper richer context that draw us in deeper that bring us back that show us something new every time we look at them. The best images have a story behind them; whether it’s personally relevant socially relevant culturally relevant or ubiquitously relevant there is a story that rises above the individual image that spreads its wings beyond the image in front of our eyes. And that’s where the professional sense of the word “editing” comes in. Vine’s already started this with their approach to editing video.Albumatic will help bring this kind of editing to photos. Backspaces has been working on this as surely hosts of others. But it’s all still raw as the tools don’t help select standardize or tell our stories. They don’t automatically recognize the context (time location friends) behind the images to pick out the stories embedded in them. They don’t make it easy to turn a camera roll of photos even if they are in sets into stories. But it’s a major room for innovation. And while it’s not in “filters” specifically it will still tap into the basic value-add of filters: condensing a human manual skilled process into a set of algorithms that make it easier to create and share. And while that may not be good for professional photographers it’s good for photography.(via The Filter Future — Photography Past Present Future — Medium),technology,vine,instagram,sharing,images,video,filtering, , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjrg4qoTbG1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

These issues brought a panel moderated by author Mark Borden and comprised of GE Head of Digital Marketing Katrina Craigwell Digitas VP of Brand Content Eric Korsh Getty Images VP of Business Development Peter Orlowsky and DeviantArt VP of Global Advertising Sales Daniel Bornstein together at SXSW for an in-depth panel discussion titled “Visual Conversation: Being at The Center of Social.” Unilaterally everyone agreed that in today’s world a catchy tagline isn’t enough:”With image-driven networks like Tumblr and Instagram taking center stage collaborative storytelling is more important than ever. In order to leverage your brand product or campaign across all channels you need strong visual content.” The panel focused on two overarching themes: how to create quality work for brands and the challenges of monetization of visuals in digital and social media.  To kick things off moderator Borden asked the group how they identify what is worth creating on behalf of brands to which Eric Korsh of Digitas replied: “You have to ask yourself ‘Is that something that I would share as a consumer?’ In that process make sure that you challenge yourself and your clients that if this is something we are doing or are we just checking the box in that ‘content area’ for today. Furthermore “You need to approach social content different from traditional ads. And you can equate this social content to fruit flies in that their lifespan is so short. You need to use it move fast learn quickly move on and apply those learnings to the next project.” Katrina of GE chimed in on the importance of keeping the consumer in mind pointing out that they recognize that in social media you’re competing with all content not just your direct competition. As a result they focus on creating great content with the goal of social distribution. In discussing the challenges of monetization DeviantArt and Getty Images had some very innovative things happening on their respective platforms. Getty Images has rolled out a variety of tools which empower people by giving them credit for their work and make sure every content creator can monetize. To accomplish this Orlowksy shared insight into the unique Getty technology stating: “We’ve got a great solution which allows us to see which images have been shared across platforms. Using fingerprinting service to track how images are shared and where they go allows for the ability to license images on the fly.”  On the DeviantArt side Bornstein shared how the site has become a discovery engine for artists empowering them to elevate their profile and giving them great exposure and opportunities they may not otherwise have. For example a piece on the site (“Sweet Halloween Dreams” by Begemott) recently generated a ton of online buzz and The Rock saw it and approached New Line to create a movie around the image which is now in the works. Overall it’s clear that today’s landscape has challenged marketers creators and media properties to come up with new and innovative ways to distribute and monetize the content. http://bit.ly/XA2lUF,content,tech,Brendan Gahan, , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjnxo8Wzrn1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:XA2lUA,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:XA2nvL, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Ours is an authenticity-obsessed age. Politicians coffee shops food art are scrutinized for evidence of inauthenticity. But some things are too real to be true…         It’s a movie! Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty has been the subject of much discussion about its authenticity. Photograph: Rex Features   Picture the tragic scenes in Crouch End north London early this year. The patrons of Harris + Hoole a local coffee shop had just learned to their horror that the supermarket chain Tesco owns a 49 per cent stake in the company. Shaken caffeine-guzzlers told the Guardian that they felt “duped” and “upset” because they’d thought it was an “independent” coffee shop. A rival coffee hawker sneered that Tesco was “trying to make money” out of “artisan values” – although presumably so was he.  Most charmingly the manager of the café confided that head office had instructed her to make the store feel as independent as possible. “We try to be independent” she said. “We want to be independent. We want to have that feel.” She is right: we all want to have that feel. But the appropriation by Tesco and Harris + Hoole of the consumer allure of “independence” and “artisan values” is a symptom of our present predicament: there is no way out of simulation. What we get in an “authentic” cultural product is still a simulacrum but one that insists even more loudly that its laminated wood-effect veneer is the real thing. Authenticity is now yet another brand value to be baked into the commodity and customers are happy to take this spectral performance of a presumed virtue as the truth. But what was so authentic about the authenticity being simulated? Today’s heroically “independent” baristas are profiting from a market that in the UK wouldn’t exist without the trail blazed in the 1990s by the now-despised big chains such as Starbucks. Thanks to them you can now open an independent coffee shop and charge considerably more than a chain while decrying the rapacity of the giants that prepared the ground for you. Be careful though not to do too well and expand too far because then you will lose all independence becoming a despicable corporation in turn. The middle-class admiration for authenticity is predicated on the patronising condition that the little man shouldn’t get too big for his boots. One way out of this hall of mirrors is to insist ever more loudly that one’s own offering is really truly authentic. Innumerable industrial products now advertise themselves as “real” following the lead of Coke’s slogan “the Real Thing”. In 2011 even Starbucks began selling salad-based lunchboxes labelled “Real Food”. A box of Rombouts’s disposable one-cup coffee filters describes its flavour as “Original Blend … Medium 3 AUTHENTIC”. Even Marks & Spencer’s men’s underwear is branded “authentic” posing the nice question of what an inauthentic pair of boxer shorts or trunks would look like. Yet authenticity can be signalled in more subtle ways. Second-hand clothes have been redescribed as “vintage” as though they were fine wines which flatteringly projects an air of discriminating scholarship on to the prospective buyer. Some new clothes call themselves pre-worn faded or distressed soaking the product in an ersatz history and off-the-peg personality. More recently such pre-ageing has become available even for far more expensive products such as electric guitars. Fender’s “Road Worn” range of Stratocasters and Telecasters features “authentic” dents and scratches and areas where the paint or varnish has been painstakingly sandpapered off; the white plastic trimmings have been yellowed as though through years of exposure to nicotine in smoky clubs.  What we value in culture can reveal much about our attitudes to hierarchy and power. Photograph: Getty Images Modern mass-media gluttony or foodism has its own cluster of presumed “authentic” virtues. The idea of “real” food is sometimes parsed adorably as food with no chemicals though all food is made of chemicals. It is widely assumed that food sold as organic is purer and closer to an assumedly benign Nature although no food is made from inorganic matter and organic farming standards sanction the use of neurotoxic fertilisers. What the unwashed non-foodist masses eat on the other hand is routinely derided as “junk” or “processed” food the poor souls doomed for ever to inauthentic scoffing. Yet the invention of processed foods such as Hovis bread in the 19th century was itself an authenticity drive a way of addressing the widespread adulteration of so many foods. Meanwhile foodists vie to identify the authentic versions of exotic dishes. In the American TV cook Julia Child’s memoir of her life in France she derides a proud Frenchwoman who insists that no true Marseillaise would add tomatoes to her bouillabaisse. Child you see has looked the recipe up in a French cookbook and there it includes tomatoes. She therefore concludes with hysterical snobbery that the Frenchwoman is an ignoramus instead of accepting that such traditional recipes come in many variations and that the idea that there is one version is a crude mistake. Here Child exhibits too the craving for authenticity of the internationally roaming glutton or gastrotourist specimens of which genre to this day compose purple paeans for the glossy magazines about the latest far-flung country in which the locals miraculously manage to cobble together authentic plates of the national victuals in their charmingly primitive kitchens. Authenticity in art is a question that goes back at least to Plato’s complaint that theatre and poetry could not convey truth. One meaning of the authenticity of a painting or text is merely that the creator has been correctly identified. But as far back as the early English novel literature was already toying with manufactured authenticity as an advertising gimmick: Defoe’sMoll Flanders (1721) claims on its title page to be “Written from her own Memorandums”; while Robinson Crusoe (1719) is not credited to its real author at all but was supposedly “Written by Himself” (that is Crusoe). Later an explicit authenticity craze occur - red in the Weimar Republic between 1924 and 1929. In reaction to the perceived excesses of expressionism a movement called the New Objectivity sprang up. Novels were marketed as “authentic” because they were supposedly based on real-world research; the story circulated that the Austrian writer Vicki Baum had worked as a maid in a large Berlin hotel in order to collect material forMenschen im Hotel later filmed as Grand Hotel. This idea that fiction derives its authenticity from reportage has persisted – up to and including novelists such as Tom Wolfe and the brain-surgeon-shadowing Ian McEwan – but heaven help you if you try to sell factbased fiction as fact. When it turned out that James Frey’s “memoir” A Million Little Pieces was fictionalised the author was pilloried for having exploited so deftly the way we venerate real emotion and experience. It seems we can no longer tolerate the playful ambiguity of the 18th century. As George W Bush memorably put it in a different context: “Fool me once shame on you. Fool me … er … you can’t get fooled again.” If you type the words “authenticity” and “authentic” into Google’s Ngram Viewer which plots graphs of the use of words in books over a given period you will find that there has been a strong uptick in usage since the early 1990s. It might be no coincidence that this parallels the rise to ubiquity of digital creative technologies. Perhaps people become more worried about art’s authenticity once they understand that modern technology makes everything liquid and endlessly revisable. Much has been made of how in Tom Hooper’s film of Les Misérables the actors are “really” singing on set though few have asked why these people can’t just talk to one another instead of dragging out what should be a 20-second dramatic interlude into an interminable ensemble singalong. In an interview Hooper boasted that his film was swimming against the tide of our “postmodern age” because it was “made without irony”. This too is an appeal to a kind of authenticity a sincerity of purpose – though it depends on a lamentably etiolated idea of irony as mere glibness. Kathryn Bigelow’s film Zero Dark Thirty meanwhile describes itself on a title card as being “based on first-hand accounts of actual events” and thus lays claim to the authenticity of reportage. (James Boswell claimed a similar documentary fidelity for his Life of Johnson: “What I have preserved … has the value of the most perfect authenticity.”) However Zero Dark Thirty’s screenwriter Mark Boal was quick to defend the film against the (silly) charge that it is pro-torture by quickly disclaiming that same documentary authority. Oh come on he told the Times exasperatedly “It’s a movie! It’s a movie! It’s a movie!” More disturbingly the unexamined hunger for authentic culture can rapidly turn into a witch-hunt. After Beyoncé sang “The Star- Spangled Banner” at Barack Obama’s inauguration the story got started that she had been lip-syncing. But in several videos available you can clearly hear two Beyoncés: there is a pre-recorded vocal plus a Beyoncé who is perfectly obviously singing live. One would like here to diagnose a mob-like rage for authenticity which fastened on a sacrificial victim with no regard for the justice of its accusations. Tellingly that Beyoncé removed an earpiece monitor during her performance was taken by the authenticity police as evidence in its own right of the inauthenticity of her act; commentators supposed that taking out the earpiece was too suspiciously ostentatious a demonstration that she had one at all. (Though she probably did it the better to hear her own voice as singers often do.) This narrative proved impervious to Beyoncé’s subsequent explanation. Because she hadn’t had a proper soundcheck or rehearsal she said she decided to leave the pre-recorded vocal in the mix as a kind of safety net while she sang live as well. “I decided to sing along with my pre-recorded performance” is what Beyoncé said – which was immediately taken as a “confession” to the very crime she thereby denied. The story was wrongly headlined on BBC News and elsewhere as “Beyoncé admits to inauguration lip-syncing”. So too persuasive a performance of authenticity will be taken as a sign of inauthenticity. The authenticity-obsessed want something to be real but they’re on a hair trigger to cry foul if it seems too real to be true. The counterproductive upshot is that gifted artists are unfairly accused of relying on technological fixes. (It’s common these days to complain about excessive use of Auto-Tune to correct singers’ pitch but some singers have naturally terrific intonation.) So the authentophiles can no longer reliably perceive what they claim to value; indeed they risk destroying it. (Why bother doing something for real if no one will believe you did?) The cult of authenticity in other words begins from an assumption that most things are fake and in doing so ensures that they will be. It also reifies a simplistic notion of what is fake to begin with. A blanket privileging of the concrete and the in-person an indie disdain for post-production or Photoshopping implicitly downgrades artworks that from their inception are computer-mediated and could not exist otherwise even though there is nothing inauthentic about an uplifting Eurotrance track or a Hockney iPad painting. The fetish for authenticity here as in the realms of food and vintage clothing shows itself to be inherently anti-modern always looking back to an imagined prelapsarian idyll. Authenticity is a useful pose in the poli - tical arena too. Claiming to be “realist” in international relations (as Obama’s new foreign policy team has been described) handily implies that your opponents purvey nothing but utopian pipe dreams. The notion of authenticity is all the more prized the more that politics appears to be nothing but spin and posture. On the New York Review of Books blog Elizabeth Drew paid the highest pos sible modern compliment to Joe Biden when she described him as “one of the most authentic politicians in Washington – he really is who he appears to be: warm and decent and never forgetting his workingclass roots … his core is consistent”. But the implication that more politicians should be who they appear to be is a weird and onerous demand that the distinction between public and private identities be collapsed for the public’s benefit – in other words that politics become more like I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!. To reserve “authentic” as the ultimate praise for a politician is right in tune with the Facebook mogul Mark Zuck - erberg’s pathological opinion that “having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity”. To define a person’s authenticity as the perfect conjunction of outward seeming and inward being is not a new idea. (Hamlet is nearly as outraged by the inauthenticity of Claudius’s acting – “That one may smile and smile and be a villain!” – as he is by Claudius having murdered his father.) But what matters most now is that such personal authenticity be performed plausibly: on reality TV paradoxically contestants routinely accuse their rivals of being “fake” or “insincere” and attempt to present as “genuine” or “real” a front as possible. In some quarters marketing claims to authenticity are almost perfectly devoid of semantic content. Consider the words of Bret Robins creative director of the exhilaratingly cartoonish megadeath-simulator video gameModern Warfare 3. In an interview he described how his team designed this World War III face-shooting fantasy in which your one-man army more or less single-handedly defeats the invading Russians: “You try to do it in a very believable and authentic way so it feels like this could actually happen.” The only things that could be described as authentic in such video games however are the lovingly modelled guns. Nothing else about Modern Warfare 3 is authentic in any way though it is believable enough when you’re there playing the game as is navigating any well-crafted made-up world. This is as it should be. When we’re at play we don’t want things to be too oppressively real. (As T S Eliot nearly wrote humankind cannot bear too much authenticity.) But what about when we are at work? The problem of authenticity in labour was one that exercised Jean-Paul Sartre in his best-known example of its opposite. Sartre developed the existentialist sense of “authenticity” that is opposed to “bad faith” and illustrated the second idea with a vignette of a waiter in a café. In Sartre’s eyes the waiter resembles a parodic automaton: he walks up to the customers too quickly; he bows too eagerly; he is oversolicitous; he carries his tray as though performing a highwire circus act. The waiter’s performance like Beyoncé’s is too real to be true. He is lip-syncing his job playing at being a waiter impersonating an idea. And this Sartre concludes is bad faith because the waiter ought to know that he cannot ever really be a waiter any more than he can be anything else. In playacting his job he is trying to evade his own nothingness his own absolute freedom. (Like the head office of Harris + Hoole Sartre wants to order you to be independent.) It is possible however to turn this analysis around as some critical Sartreans have done and to defend the poor waiter. Gary Cox in his excellent The Existentialist’s Guide to Death the Universe and Nothingness argues that the waiter far from being deluded that he really is a waiter is consciously acting “with ironical intent”. In this sense he is a paragon of Sartrean authenticity because “he strives to take full responsibility for the reality of his situation choosing himself positively in his situation by throwing himself wholeheartedly into his chosen role”. Might one essay a similar rescue tactic for Sartre’s other example of bad faith? The philosopher describes a young woman on a first date who chooses to ignore the flirtatious undercurrents of her suitor’s conver - sation. Eventually the man takes her hand but she just lets it lie there listlessly. The moment has come to rebuff or accept his advances but she does neither. This Sartre sternly concludes is bad faith. The woman knows she is free but she is refusing to exercise her freedom. Yet you might prefer to say that she is authentically exercising her freedom to delay her decision rather than allowing herself to be forced into action at a moment not of her own choosing by the man’s less-than-subtle version of seduction. Such revisionist interpretations could have the happy effect of saving Sartre from himself – because the Frenchman’s insistence that the waiter in particular is acting in bad faith looks rather unfortunately condescending. (Did Sartre not playact the role of the philosopher-intellectual very well?) Despite the astringent delights of his philosophy he seems to suffer a deficit of empathy at this moment – one which may remind us that in our day too the quest for “authenticity” often involves a crushing snobbery. The anti-corporate No Logo wisdom about consumer brands is that they like many instances of the very word “authentic” are floating signifiers vacant cash generators that hoodwink the public. But a brand does have some use in its role as the modern equivalent of the maker’s mark: if you like something bearing it you can more safely assume that something else is of similar quality and reliability. It is only when the sign of the brand comes to be understood in its own right as valuable that we sink into decadence as when a fashion writer for the Independent burbled recently: “Each garment is carefully embossed with the prestigious Ralph Lauren logo.” Yet it is precisely in the marketing of highend brands that we can perceive the key aspect of the modern authenticity mania. Such commodities are sometimes called “aspirational” because that is now how society has silently agreed to redefine aspiration: as the desire to control more wealth and to own more expensive objects. So what is the implicit bargain when we buy an “authentic” Hermès bag? Or a Hublot watch a clockwork marvel costing tens of thousands of pounds which prides itself like all “luxury” analogue watches precisely on the amusing superfluity of its engineering? We are being sold the assurance that nimble-fingered workers in a French leather-working atelier or a Swiss horlogerie laboratory have sunk hundreds or thousands of man-hours into its making. The authenticity of such an aspirational brand’s product boils down to the promise that numberless faceless artisans have lab - oured personally on your behalf. A similar fantasy underlies the ferocious insistence that a coffee shop be “artisanal” and “independent” the indolent demand for a pre-aged Stratocaster or the hysterical suspicion that a singer might not have been working hard enough to entertain us. The self-appointed guardians of authenticity it seems want desperately to believe that they are at the top of the labour pyramid. In cultural markets that are all too disappointingly accessible to the masses the authenticity fetish disguises and renders socially acceptable a raw hunger for hierarchy and power. http://bit.ly/nwnK3G,Arts & Letters Daily,authenticity,design,thuudung, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjmscmfmAs1s75lgto1_r1_500.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:rexfeatures_1997508l.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:New%20Image2.JPG, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Women are rejecting IT as a career. In the early 1980s around the time Apple issued its IPO and Time magazine named the PC its Machine of the Year women accounted for just over 37% of the students earning bachelor’s degrees in computer science. By 2010 that percentage had fallen to a little more than 17% according to latest available data from the National Science Foundation. Sandberg who is COO at Facebook argues that women have to be more assertive to “lean in” as she writes in her book Lean In: Women Work and the Will to Lead. But women are under-represented in IT something that’s been obvious for years at male-dominated tech conferences. U.S. labor data backs this up. Last year women held only 26% of the jobs in computer-related occupations. That represented a one-percentage-point increase from 2011 but that slight uptick wasn’t enough to counter an overall decline in the number of female IT professionals since 2000 when women’s share of the computer-related jobs pool hit its peak at nearly 30% according labor data analyzed by the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). Tammi Pirri vice president of human resources at Black Duck Software an open-source software services and development firm sees what’s going on first hand. She said that in her eight years at Black Duck “we’ve only had one female engineering intern but we’ve had 10 male engineering interns.” The decline in women studying computer science in college aside Pirri believes that Sandberg is right: “Women must find a way to ask for what they want without being perceived in a negative way” she said. “That’s the challenge and where women need to lean in and not just assert what they want but show it’s deserved.” Jenny Slade the communications director at NCWIT noted that many people have criticized Sandberg for her focus on “changing the women rather than changing the system.” “But frankly if she’d written a polemic on institutional bias in the workplace she’d have been criticized for painting women as victims” said Slade who argues that “changing the status quo starts with a conversation that leads people to take action.” That discussion might include people such as Kim Stevenson the vice president and CIO of Intel one of 24 female CIOs in Fortune 100 companies. Stevenson said Intel has done things to help women advance their careers. Among other things the company offers mentoring programs and opportunities for network-building — an activity that Sandberg champions. The chip maker’s Women at Intel Network has 22 chapters. “No one likes to feel that they are a unit of one” said Stevenson. She doesn’t share Sandberg’s view that progress for women has stalled but she said that she believes more can be done. Intel’s efforts have paid off said Stevenson. The rate of attrition among women is low and the company says the number of female employees in mid- to senior-level technical jobs has increased 24% since 2004. Kathy Harris managing director of Harris Allied an executive recruiting firm specializing in technology is among those who believe women need to create a professional support network. “In pure technology departments men still outnumber women by as much as nine to one” said Harris. “The sole woman in a predominantly male team often feels a sense of isolation.” There are many theories about why women and especially girls aren’t considering IT-related training. Culture plays a role some argue. Karie Willyerd vice president of learning and social adoption at SAP wonders if unflattering depictions of engineers in popular culture — like those in the comic strip Dilbert — have discouraged girls from thinking about careers in IT. But the cultural message may be shifting said Willyerd who points to things like building block maker Lego’s efforts to attract girls and expose them to engineering. “[Software engineering] is not only well paid but highly flexible and conducive to a woman that wants to work throughout their children’s formative years” said Paula Hunter executive director of the Outercurve Foundation a nonprofit that offers a forum where open-source and commercial software developers can come together. A high percentage of startups are also founded by engineers she notes. Stephanie Reel senior vice president for management systems and information services at John Hopkins Health System said that in the healthcare field she has worked for and with men and women “who have been fair balanced and professional — in a business world that is often dominated by women.” Women have a significant presence in healthcare overall in part because a high percentage of the people who go into nursing are women she said. But Reel does agree that the most senior positions in leading U.S. organizations including those in healthcare are still mostly held by men. It may be more evolution than revolution at work she argues. “Perhaps men are choosing to be more focused on linear career paths” said Reel “while women are sometimes choosing to be more curious and more patient seeking rewards and recognition in different ways — perhaps seeking to influence the future of an organization more broadly than a man might.” http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9237532/Facebook_s_Sandberg_stirs_debate_among_women_in_IT, ,technology,women,lean in,sandberg, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

How do I collect the spots? How does the lancet work? Your kit includes complete instructions.  Blood spot testing is pretty quick you just press the 1mm lancet firmly against your finger and you feel a quick ‘bee sting’ exactly what diabetics experience several times a day when checking their blood sugar.   Even after doing 10-20 of these tests at once we can say its hard to tell you did it at all the next day.  As warm fingers are best for spots we recommend you warm your fingers under hot water before doing the test but feel free to figure out what works best for you. We suggest you collect spots from the outside tip of the fingers as there’s great circulation there and you’ll hardly notice you did it. How many blood spots do I need to provide?   Our T20 Spot Kit comes with detailed instructions and a card with room for 5 blood spots to be collected.  One spot can be enough to get your reading but its more accurate if we have multiple samples and can calculate an average from those.  When applying your blood drop to the card try to get as big a drop as possible and fill the circle on the card.  It can take practice to figure out where on your finger you might have a good capillary bed to do this or you might have to warm up your fingers if they are cold! When will I get my results? We will be testing and posting results in the order we receive the cards. Those who purchased tests first will receive results first. We intend to being posting result profiles in the Spring 2013. Once we get on a roll we intend to post your results within one week after receiving your card. What do the Packs contain? Each pack includes T20 Spot Card(s) alcohol swabs band aids 2-3 lancets per card (in case you need more than one prick to get five spots) instructions and return envelopes. For Gold Card subscribers we will include 6 cards at a time. Once you have used up your cards we will send the next subscription fulfillment. If I get one of the Gold Packs can I spread my tests over different time periods? Yes you can use your 36 (monthly Gold Card) over any time span you like.  Actually the longer you spread them out the more free tests you will get incorporated into your panel as we continue to offer more and more tests. As a Gold Card subscriber you will get all your tests as they become available with no extra work on your part.  We plan to make additional tests an add-on option non-subscribers may pay for if they like.  Also for Gold Card subscribers the clock doesn’t start until we send you your first results online. If I get one of the Gold Packs can I share my test cards with friends and family? No each card is linked to your profile. We can only process data for subscribers who have paid and created a profile. If you would like to test your friends and family they will need to purchase their own cards and create their own profiles.   , ,technology,quantified self,self-tracking,blood test, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Do you use a computer mobile phone electronic gadget or pen and paper to record your work sleep exercise diet mood or anything else? Would you like to share your methods and learn from what others are doing? If so you are in the right place. This short intro will help you get you oriented. What is Quantified Self? Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects the tools we use tips we’ve gleaned lessons we’ve learned. We blog meet face to face and collaborate online. There are three main “branches” to our work. *The Quantified Self blog and community site. You are here! This is the central hub where we keep track of all important goings-on and you will soon be able to make connections develop ongoing collaborations and share detailed documentation of your personal projects. *Quantified Self Show&Tell meetings. These are face-to-face meetings very fun and interesting where you can see QS projects first hand and meet QS people in your local area. The meetings started in the San Francisco Bay Area but local chapters are springing up all over the world. If there is not yet a meeting in your area and you wish there were you can learn how to start one by reading: How to Start Your Own QS Show&Tell. *Quantified Self Conference. This is a conference for users and tool makers interested in self-tracking systems. It is a “working meeting” for the QS community (40 groups worldwide) where we gather inspire and learn from each other as we share and collaborate on self-tracking projects. We also explore the potential effects of self-tracking on ourselves and society. If you are an advanced user designer tech inventor entrepreneur journalist scientist or health professional please join us for a weekend of collaboration and inspiration! Who is responsible for Quantified Self? The QS blog and community are maintained and moderated by Alexandra Carmichael Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf. Regular contributors include Rajiv Mehta (Toolmaker Talks) Ernesto Ramirez (Numbers from around the Web) and other QS friends around the world. Each of the QS Show&Tell meetings has its own set of organizers. When you sign up at the link you will be able to contact the local organizer. We also maintain a complete list of local QS Show&Tell organizers with links to meetups and some additional information. Administration of the web site production of the QS conference and other community support functions are the work of Quantified Self Labs. What other resources are there? The Quantified Self Forum is a place for the community to discuss any topics they want. The Complete QS Guide to Self-Tracking is a collection of tools apps and projects. Our goal is to gather and organize the world’s collective self-tracking resources in one place. Dive in now and explore some of the Tools or Members who are part of this site. Videos from the meetups are available at the Quantified Self Vimeo Group. Selected press mentions are here. Follow us on Twitter @quantifiedself. How can I help?

The self-trackers who near-obsessively capture and analyze their own data are part of a growing “Quantified Self” movement. Interested in giving self-tracking a try? Self-tracker Peter Zandan an executive at Hill Knowlton Strategies who headed up a panel on Quantified Self this year at South by Southwest helped us curate this list of apps and devices to get more data feedback from your daily life. If you’re just getting started the most “mainstream” self-tracking devices are the Fitbit Jawbone UP and Nike Fuelband. Apple’s getting in on this wristband-tracking market with its iWatch which is expected to come out at the end of this year. For heart rate monitoring devices Garmin and Polar both make options that self-trackers like. Food monitoring apps include MyFitnessPal and MyPlate. “[These are] great for folks who want to do more than count calories” Zandan said. If you want to dig a little deeper these self-tracking devices apps and systems might teach you something that you don’t know about yourself. 23andMe: A DNA analysis service that provides information and tools for you to learn about your genetic traits disease risk and ancestry; you mail a saliva sample for laboratory testing. Talking20: Amino acid testing to monitor what is happening in your body over time; you mail small blood samples and receive digital results. Moodscope: An app that allows you to track your mood each day using an online card game; look at scores over time and share with friends. Zeo: A comprehensive sleep monitoring system that includes a lightweight headband bedside display online analytical tools and email-based personalized coaching program. Equanimity: An app that provides reminders and feedback for your meditation practice; it includes a timer journal for note-taking and historical graphics.

Sarkeesian sought $6000 on Kickstarter to produce slicker versions of her earlier DIY series and she was smeared by vile angry gamer-dudes who created games where you could beat the crap out of her for the sin of identifying as a feminist and daring to question the portrayal of gender in games. The happy ending to this shameful episode is that her Kickstarter became a good-people vs goons plebiscite and would up raising $158922. The first installment is “Damsels in Distress” and is a smart well-researched wonderfully presented history of the woman-waiting-for-a-hero trope through gaming history. It’s just in time for International Women’s Day and is a wonderful kickoff for a new series.

It’s the go-to framework for endless heroic adventures where fabulous male heroes journey to save [insert female captured by villain here]. One of the earliest of these is the classic tale of a plucky mustachioed plumber on a vertical girder-climbing quest to save his lady Pauline from the barrel-throwing primate Donkey Kong. It was the game that would set the stage for a long series of Mario adventures where his princess would continue to be captured and wind up “in another castle.” After being introduced to the game Mike Mika’s 3-year-old daughter Ellis asked why she couldn’t “play as the girl” and rescue Mario instead. (She’d recently played Super Mario Bros. 2 where you could play as Princess Toadstool). She was disappointed to find that she couldn’t. So Mika a game designer by trade and chief creative officer at Other Ocean Interactive set out to flip the script on the game and make it happen. He spent a furious night of hacking through the game’s code and swapping out all of the Mario graphical sprites and color palettes for new ones of Pauline. He posted his progress on Facebook and YouTube to share with friends. Soon the projectfound its way to social-sharing site Reddit where it went viral and earned Mika several superlatives across the Internet including “feminist hero dad” and “dad of the year.” The end result he writes in Wired was met with a lot of excitement from his daughter.   “She was excited! But for all she knew I just figured out how to get Pauline to work. And that was fine. I wasn’t expecting it to change her life. We played for a bit. And some more. And again later. You know what? She really did seem to enjoy the game more. For whatever reason she was more motivated to play as Pauline than as Mario. I can’t read into that too much because it does feel a bit like a new game to her still. So we’ll see how she does after a week with it.”   This isn’t the first time someone has done something like this though the first time with such a classic game. Last year Mike Hoye re-scripted a Zelda game to make the hero a girl for his daughter as well. Mika however says he didn’t set out to push any sort of feminist agenda or statement. He writes that he simply wanted to “keep that little grin lit up on my daughter’s face every time we sit down to play games together.” This also isn’t the first time Mika has used his programming skills for the ladies in his life. According to comments from friends on Reddit Mika also apparently proposed to his wife by hiding a secret code in a game he was working on at the time.

His idea worth spreading? That cellphones are “emasculating.”… With one word Brin appears to have shot in the direction of both feet: both possibly alienating Google’s male Android smartphone customers and offputting women who might otherwise be in the market for Google Glass… In order to guess at what Google is seeing in terms of gender breakdown amid this abundance of marketing information TechCrunch collected close to 11000 Google+ posts and 22000 tweets tagged with #ifihadglass and looked at the likely gender of the authors’ first names. The results suggest that if Google isn’t yet worried about encouraging female adoption of Google Glass perhaps it should be… To be taken with skepticism here’s the breakdown of the TechCrunch analysis of the likely gender of authors of #ifihadglass postings on Google+: For the 7358 Google+ postings whose authors had first names assigned to a gender group 86% were guessed to be posted by males and 14% by females. Including 517 uncertain cases the numbers water down to 80% male and 13% female. Among the uncertain cases 77% where thought to be ‘likely male’ and 23% ‘likely female’. 27% of the overall 10782 found Google+ postings tagged with #ifihadglass were authored by people’s whose names were deemed ambiguous. For Twitter: For the 10524 Twitter tweets whose authors had first names assigned to a gender group 80% were guessed to be male and 20% female. Including 807 uncertain cases the numbers adjust to 74% male and 19% female. Among the uncertain cases 72% where thought to be ‘likely male’ and 28% ‘likely female’. 48% of the overall 21684 tweets found at the time were deemed as authored by someone whose first name was too ambiguous to gender. …Despite all the caveats the numbers present a strong argument why Brin might be tempted to play up the “masculinity” angle for Google Glass: among early customers talking about “#ifihadglass” about four out of five appear to be men. The other edge to this truth is that while it might be tempting to preach to the male demographic choir in fact Google should perhaps be doing the opposite: encouraging early adoption among women. Without a representative customer base selling the first generation of this technology to their peers Google could end up with the next Segway. An informal mining of the many uses suggested by these prospective customers — among them health and recreation (traveling coaching workout biofeedback biking baby care) health and emergency services (emergency care diagnosis surgery) reference (instructional material study aids/practice translation search research image recognition) location (GPS/maps directions traffic) communication (reading sharing teaching training tours) productivity (note taking tasks) and cooking — none but the very visually- or manually intensive applications scream for the immediate abandonment of the ubiquitous and “emasculating” smartphone. In this case as in others data seem to back common sense that it’s not a great marketing strategy to alienate a critical and already-trailing customer segment.

In Japanese art and textile printing the use of patterns has a long tradition. In Japanese architecture layering is an established technique that has already inspired the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Now the laboratory of renowned architect Kengo Kuma has developed a technically sophisticated methodology that unites patterns and layering in a single structural concept for the first time.  The book Patterns and Layering presents innovative structures that are created by stacking fragile patterned layers. Although each individual layer can contain a variety of patterns it will nevertheless still completely fulfill its structural responsibilities. The results are strikingly delicate yet remarkably stable.  The book’s detailed texts explain how layering and patterns function as spatial tools with which one can create extraordinary structures that are able to coexist in harmony with nature people and culture. Patterns and Layering not only explores historical contexts and developments but also shows cutting-edge experiments that were realized with valuable input from Kengo Kuma and his colleague Yusuke Obuchi. According to Kuma the book “has the potential to begin a new architectural and design revolution.”  Editors Salvator-John A. Liotta and Matteo Belfiore as well as other contributors worked closely with Kengo Kuma at his research laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Thanks to Kuma’s enthusiasm for the book as well as the inclusion of design details such as silkscreen prints and calligraphy Patterns and Layering embodies the Japanese understanding of space nature and architecture—page for page layer for layer.

When asked about how Tumblr got started Karp said that he started it in 2005 as a simple tool he built for himself. Karp explained that he had tried other tools but became frustrated by their limitations. The Tumblr founder went on to say that he realized most blogs were designed for writers. Karp explained that he tried other blogging formats that were available at the time (WordPress Blogger etc.) but never felt as if any were the right fit for him because the emphasis was always on writing and he wanted to focus on multimedia content. With Tumblr he consolidated all the content into one place very easily which became a tool to help people easily express themselves and act as a representation of their online identity. When asked about the site’s phenomenal growth Karp reflected back and modestly admitted that he had no intention or idea it would rise to such popularity. He figured a few friends might enjoy the tool so he posted the first version and within a month Tumblr had hundreds of thousands of users  Karp attributes much of the site’s success to that early community which “rose to the occasion and created blogs that didn’t look like any other blogs.” This engagement convinced him that he should nurture it and continue to iterate on the platform. What he saw and sought to nurture was the use of Tumblr as a tool for curation which in itself can be a creative process. For Karp Tumblr facilitates two key behaviors: social behavior to share and human behavior to curate (what to wear posting of photos etc.). Karp explains: “Many of us are not the creators but they’re [the creators] creative and compel us and pass on to us as colors and words we use to express ourselves.” The founder spoke about his belief that one of the things that makes Tumblr so unique is its vibrant community. For a long time in early versions comments were lacking but Karp felt like YouTube comments were horrible and that design influences how people interact and what they say.

45373488567,2013-03-14 22:36:40 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45373488567/proenza-schouler-weaves-web-art-inspired-fashion,photo, , ,Proenza Schouler Weaves Web Art-Inspired Fashion Film Today the high-fashion womenswear brand Proenza Schouler released their new Tumblr-inspired fashion film directed by David Sims and Eddie the Wheel. It’s an assaulting array of lo-fi neon textures quick edits and layered video collages designed for the shortest of attention spans. The clothes featured take a backseat to the brand’s assertion that it’s hip to digital culture and the aesthetics that have been circulating online under the umbrella of net art.  The video (above) accompanies Proenza’s website relaunch and a whole slew of efforts intended to position the luxury brand as #new #hip #trendy #cuttingedge–from controversial YouTube films directed by Harmony Korine to GIFs by net artist Jeanette Hayes. The brand’s designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez differentiate themselves from other luxury brands interested in tapping into old-fashioned stifled elegance. “This Internet aesthetic we’re talking about there’s no nostalgia to it. I think that scares people” McCollough told the Business of Fashion. “A lot of luxury brands like to fall back on nostalgia because nostalgia feels luxurious to them. We’re into luxury but we’re also equally interested in contemporary culture.”   Nostalgia is an interesting choice of words. McCollough seems to be forgetting that contemporary culture and particularly the net art Tumblr aesthetic is loaded with nostalgia just nostalgia for a more recent era than the roaring twenties and drop-waist dresses.  For example the aesthetics in Proenza’s video harken back to early digital effects reminiscent of 80s movies like  Tron and  Dune. And GIFs turned 26 this year. One of Proenza’s new GIFs featured above an anime cartoon of a young girl in her bedroom immediately brings to mind the 90s fad for Sailor Moon. This stuff isn’t new. But what is new is our ability to access and circulate these images and moving images via platforms like Tumblr. The internet or at least how we use it accelerates the cycle of nostalgia. An example of the nostalgic effects in the new Proenza Schouler fashion film. In the same interview McCollough told the Business of Fashion that Proenza isn’t “your mom’s luxury brand.” But I think moms might be the only people to whom this Tumblr-aesthetic is going to seem totally new. The trend has already made the transition from marginal to mainstream with its appearance in Azaelia Banks’ music video and Rihanna’s performance on SNL last December. And it’s hit the fashion world too just see Kenzo’s fashion film directed by Natalia Stuyk released two weeks ago. Considering the price tag of the goods Proenza’s hocking–close to a thousand dollars for a dress–their target customer is probably not the 20-something on Tumblr but instead the uptown woman who wants a piece of it. Digital culture and the aesthetics associated with it are only bound to get more and more popular—and as they do we can expect them to intersect with the fashion world more and more. But it’s not just about fashion capitalizing on digital culture and the aesthetics associated with it. Digital culture and fashion culture are intersecting and breeding a culture all their own just check out witty fashion web magazine DIS Magazine or Greta Larkins GIF-based fashion Tumblr. Proenza Schouler is smart to get on board.

PARIS France — At last week’s Louis Vuitton show all eyes were on Kate Moss as she walked down the runway in a long-sleeved embroidered tulle dress and a choppy short black wig. But while the Croydon-born supermodel was certainly attention-grabbing a more interesting surprise was tucked into the show notes that awaited each guest. There hidden between celebrations of the house’s savoir faire and high quality materials was this sentence penned by Vuitton’s creative director Marc Jacobs: “The house’s Monogram and Damier canvas are nowhere to be seen on the catwalk.” Especially in light of last season’s Vuitton showing inspired by the label’s signature two-tone checkerboard known as Damier the disownment of two of the brand’s most recognisable visual signifiers seemed like an about-face. But rather than being a seasonal whim on Jacobs’ part the shift reflects a new strategy outlined earlier this year by the designer’s boss Bernard Arnault chairman and chief executive of LVMH the luxury conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton. After the fashion and leather goods company which accounts for more than half of LVMH’s profits reported for the second quarter in a row its slowest growth in revenue since 2009 Arnault said on an earnings call in January that the brand would open fewer stores focus on more luxurious materials and reduce the visibility of its monogrammed products. “Of course it would be easier for Louis Vuitton to boost its revenue; all it would take would be to launch ten new products with the monogram product but down the road it’s not a good strategy” he said. But what does it mean when the world’s largest luxury brand shifts its focus away from the very trademarks on which its success has been built? Clearly Louis Vuitton has detected that some of its customers are tiring of the brand’s increasingly ubiquitous ‘LV’ monogram and its equally familiar Damier begging a question with wide-ranging ramifications for the sector. Has luxury logo fatigue reached a tipping point? As LVMH generates 28 percent of its sales in Asia (excluding Japan) according to the group’s annual results it’s not surprising that Vuitton’s strategic reorientation is inextricably linked to shifting consumption habits in China. To be clear the logo-loving Chinese consumer hasn’t disappeared and still accounts for a significant portion of revenue. According to Bain & Company’s ‘Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study’ published in cooperation with Italian luxury goods trade association Altagamma “Consumers in China remain focused on conspicuous logos. Fifty-five percent of consumers outside of Beijing and Shanghai say they will buy more products showing logos.” Similarly a recent survey by the Hurun Report identified Vuitton as the top preferred brand when it comes to gifting by wealthy Chinese men. But the rise of a more discerning consumer who eschews blatant brand signifiers is putting new pressure on brands like Louis Vuitton to adapt their communications strategies and product assortments. “Chinese shoppers in Beijing and Shanghai are now truly global luxury consumers. They are shifting away from typical emerging market preference for logos and other visible signs of luxury spending and shifting to a global mindset of uniqueness high-quality and understatement in luxury items” according to the Bain study. “Luxury in China is now about being ‘in the know’ versus being ‘in the show’” said Bruno Lannes a Bain partner in Greater China and lead author of the Chinese edition of the study. “Changes in what Chinese shoppers want are now a central issue for the global luxury sector’s largest brands.” Of course logo fatigue is not new. Nor is it unique to China. The phenomenon swept over Japan Europe and the US long before emerging in less developed markets. In the 1990s the ‘LV’ monogram was highly popular in American and European cities but slowly drifted away (often relegated to the provinces) as more savvy and demanding consumers sought out less obvious brand signifiers like iconic shapes or signature design treatments — Chanel’s quilting for example — that only a select like-minded minority would recognise. By 2001 logo fatigue was pervasive enough in the West to power the rise of ‘stealth luxury’ brands like Bottega Veneta which over the last decade grew from a small family-run enterprise to a global powerhouse driving over $1 billion-plus sales. But in the last few years even companies like Gucci which continued to rely heavily on logo-ed products well into the 2000s have changed direction. In 2010 François-Henri Pinault chairman and chief executive of PPR which owns Gucci told WWD “Our groups are moving toward fewer logos more discreet luxury. It’s a question of adapting our ranges very rapidly to this new perception of luxury a luxury which is more subtle more sophisticated which is what we are doing.” Conventional wisdom however said that conspicuous logos would remain desirable in emerging markets like China. But in a country where luxury brands have expanded their retail presence aggressively — Vuitton is available even in provincial cities like Guangxi and Hefei — logo fatigue is starting to take hold sooner than expected. Indeed it’s taken Chinese consumers only a few years to approach the level of maturation that took more than a decade to emerge in Japan. It goes without saying that being seen as commonplace is poison for any luxury brand thus Arnault’s plans to limit Vuitton’s store openings and focus its communications on high-value logo-free leather goods that signal their specialness more discreetly through shape and materials. But as Vuitton shifts course the challenge will be striking the right balance between exclusivity and popularity to remain profitable.

45346512143,2013-03-14 15:24:35 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45346512143/got-it-made-now-here-comes-the,photo, , ,Got it MADE  “Now here comes the science behind-the-scenes yadda yadda yadda…” When I first heard that MADE the New York FASHION WEEK initiative started by Jenné Lombardo Mazdack Rassi and Keith Baptista was coming to Paris I along with some Parisian fashion PRs let out an audible “Woo-hoo!”  To say that MADE’s sponsorship of shows and presentations and gathering of young designers at Milk Studios in New York has significantly altered New York Fashion would be an understatement.  I barely rememeber NYFW pre-Milk MADE.  I do recall being struck by how naff the Bryant Park tents seemed in comparison to the shows and presentations that I was seeing at Milk Studios when the initiative first began.  For me the Lincoln Centre is really not that much better than the tents (sponsor activity practically outweighs shows) and so it’s even more of a relief to hail a cab outside and head down to Milk Studios.  What Lombardo Rassi and Baptista have successfully done is to serve designers first and get the taste level of the initiative pretty much spot on creaming the best of what’s new young and exciting in New York (and beyond - look at the rise of the London-based brand like Ostwald Helgason who could arguable attribute their success to Milk MADE).  Even commercial tie-ups which are present on-site don’t feel heavy handed but actually serve a purpose - for instance a Walgreens tuck shop handing out free pretzels or Lexus cars giving people rides.  The thing I like the most is the inclusivity.  When those evening presentations roll around there’s a great hustle and bustle at Milk Studios where large volumes of people get to see three or four designers within a one-two hour slot allowing word to spread through social media blogs as well as the usual press guns.  It’s win-win for industry folk without a great deal of time people who don’t necessarily get tickets to the bigger shows and the designers who get to showcase their work to a large audience.      The challenge then was to bring all of that to Paris a city that isn’t necessarily known for showcasing young designers at fashion week.  The call to support young domestic talent is on a high though.  The pressure for ANDAM to award French winners has resulted in a mini-wave of young designers that could be called Paris’ Bright Young Things - Olympia Le Tan Julien David Anthony Vaccarello all come to mind.  MADE made their first headway in Paris last season by sponsoring the shows of all three designers.  This season though they declared their presence properly with an official central venue to hold and host their first MADE in Paris show programme.  At the Hôtel Salomon de Rothshild this season MADE put on six on-schedule shows and six presentations over the course of four days.  Did it live up to my ludicrously high expectations given how grateful I am for its mere existence at New York Fashion Week?  Well yes and no…    …………………………………………………………………………………… The shows that were part of MADE’s roster are in essence shows that already existed on-schedule at Paris Fashion Week.  A.F. Vandevorst and Sharon Wauchob are dab hands at PFW and the likes of Gareth Pugh and Anthony Vaccarello are as this Business of Fashion piece points out designers who can essentially show on their own without the help of an initiative like MADE and get sponsorship elsewhere.  That said bringing them into a sumptuous space like the intimate salons of the Hôtel Salomon de Rothshild was a thrilling experience for different reasons.  I’m merely reviewing the MADE concept so I’ll leave out the specifics of the collections for now.  Finally we were able to see Vaccarello’s technical prowess up close in a show context and see all that oozing leather melding into well-judged hardware.  Likewise Gareth Pugh’s finale of bing bag couture could be be better appreciated when they were fluttering by 40cm away from my vantage point.     Anthony Vaccarello images from Bureau Betak blog (really fantastic showcase for their show production work by the way)  Gareth Pugh show photography Jacques Habbah for Dazed Digital I didn’t get to see Yang Li’s presentation but this London-based designer made a confident presentation debut concentrating on refined double-faced textiles and dramatic lengths.       …………………………………………………………………………………… I was excited to go and see the French knitwear trio Piece D’Anarchive whose work I’ve actually never seen before in person but I had interviewed for a piece in Elle UK.  They’re all about French savoir-faire and the projections of knitting looms and an installation of yarn spools emphasised that.  Models flitted in and out with the outfits on but we were mostly left to inspect the pieces on the rails.  It’s once again a very concise collection exploring texture and the ultimate boundaries of precise knitwear.  They benefited from the intimate presentation setting too but it would have been great to see a line-up of models in the collection rather than the odd ensemble floating in and out of the room.             …………………………………………………………………………………… A complete lack of models didn’t hurt Dusan’s presentation at all as he presented his Victorian-inflected collection in a burnt wooden beam installation on masked mannequins.  I’m a great admirer of the quiet but powerful sensibility of this Serbian-born Milan-based designer.  His are the type of clothes that can be arranged in a static installation free for all to contemplate his astute choice of fabrics and comfortable yet dramatic silhouettes.  It certainly fed the tactile desire to touch his clothes.           …………………………………………………………………………………… LA-based label En Noir designer by Rob Garcia made their first proper seasonal debut at New York Fashion Week at Milk Studios and they were asked to come to Paris as well to feed the young crowd in the city of lights who have a penchant for dark and brooding clothes.  Kanye and A$AP Rocky are apparently fans.  It’s not my aesthetic cup of char but it shows that MADE in Paris could be a showcase stomping ground for designers not based in Paris at all.       …………………………………………………………………………………… Jewellery designer Ligia Dias couldn’t showcase a full collection at MADE because she was about to give birth but instead chose to create an installation with the help of an International Herald Tribune newspaper girl - a clear reference to Jean-Luc Goddard’s Breathless as well as Kurt Cobain’s lighter.  No really.  According to its owner artist Scott King he caught the lighter in his hand at a Nirvana gig in Birmingham in 1989.  It’s supposed to question our ideas of what is diposable and what isn’t.  How it related to Dias’ jewellery which I’m a huge fan of I’m not entirely sure but it was definitely an interesting way of presenting something in the absence of the designer.        …………………………………………………………………………………… Heaven Tanudiredja’s jewellery presentation was a lot more visual and frankly visceral as well.  I’m glad he got the chance to properly showcase his talent as he’s been toiling away in showrooms for far too long.  It was his moment to shine and he grabbed the eyeballs with his collection inspired by troubled minds.  With pieces named after medical conditions like Pyromania Anorexia Nervosa and Agoraophobia you’d expect the worse but in fact they’re visual representations of the complexities of the mind.  Little hands teensy chairs and mini-cogs going round and round are all symbols of the brain at work.  It swerved in a different direction from the beautiful encrusted gem formations of his past work but instead used things that were literal and recognisable to build up into pieces of beautiful chaos.                 …………………………………………………………………………………… Keith Baptista noted that injecting the “culture” element into the programme would be the challenge for next season in addition to gaining more commercial sponsorship something which has proven more difficult to obtain in Paris.  There really wasn’t that youth-driven buzz that you get at Milk Studios in New York but then again Paris is a very different beast.  A venue as lofty as Hôtel Salomon de Rothshild whilst beautiful can feel a little stiff for the sort of energy that Made is aiming for.  The presence of Radio Garage which I went on as a guest helped bring something buzzy to the space but it was well-tucked away from view.  It would have been nice to have additional complimentary activities to the shows as you wandered around these neo-classical high-ceilinged lounges as there certainly was the space for it.   Then there’s the selection of designers.  It was a great start but Baptista also said that they want the programme to be bigger for next season.  Hopefully they will scout harder and bring on names that I personally see in Paris showrooms which could do with a presentation platform.  A lot of the designers that were part of MADE whilst brilliant didn’t feel very “new” to me but perhaps that’s the innate discoverer inside of me talking.  Jacquemus for instance put on a stonker of a show this season in a Parisian indoor piscine and perhaps he’ll be reluctant to give up that freedom of venue choice (although it has to be said in New York Made do sponsor designers who don’t show at Milk Studios) but he’s one example of a young Paris-based designer who could do with the sponsored showcase.  Niche labels such as Lahssan who has made a streetstyle hit with his trenchcoats or Wanda Nylon and their see-through outerwear could do interesting presentations.  Or beyond the Paris-based Japanese labels such as Toga which is gaining steam on the international stockist front could be another great addition.  They did a small presentation this season on their own but again centralising these smallscale presentations and grouping the unfamiliar all into one venue and giving them multiplied exposure would be far more fruitful than trekking around Paris trying to squeeze everything in between what is already a packed show schedule.  It’s still very much early days for MADE in Paris but these first steps could potentially augment Paris Fashion Week into not just a place to see the houses the biggies and the culmination of a

The research team headed by architect and Mediated Matter Groupfounder Neri Oxman attached tiny magnets to the heads of silkworms to discover how they “print” their pupal casings around themselves. “We’ve managed to motion-track the silkworm’s movement as it is building its cocoon” said Oxman. “Our aim was to translate the motion-capture data into a 3D printer connected to a robotic arm in order to study the biological structure in larger scales.” The pavilion is part of a research project to explore ways of overcoming the existing limitations of additive manufacturing at architectural scales and follows recent proposals for a house made of 3D printed concrete sections and a dwelling made of prefabricated plastic elements. Top image: colour scanning electron microscope image of the exterior surface of a silk moth cocoon. Image by Dr. James C. Weaver Wyss Institute Harvard University Today’s 3D printers are mostly able to produce homogeneous materials with the same properties throughout whereas natural materials often exhibit varying properties or “gradients”. A silk worm for example is able to produce a cocoon with a tough exterior and soft interior by varying the density and pattern of the silk fibres it deposits. “The worm rotates its head in 8-figure movements so as to allow for the distribution of silk its density its thickness and through these manipulations it controls its mechanical properties based on structural and environmental constraints” says Oxman. “For instance the inner layers of the cocoon are relatively soft while the outer layers of the cocoon are stiffer. The silkworm than varies the properties of silk according to function and can be considered the biological equivalent of a mobile 3D multi-material printer.” The Silk Pavilion will be built using digital fabrication technologies at MIT’s Media Lab. It will be installed on 22 April and will measure around 12 feet by 12 feet. Oxman believes that freeform printing using robotic arms has more potential for architecture than existing 3D printing systems which use gantries that can only move in three directions and which require complex support structures to be printed at the same time to prevent the building components collapsing under their own weight. “In traditional 3D printing the gantry-size poses an obvious limitation; it is defined by three axes and typically requires the use of support material both of which are limiting for the designer who wishes to print in larger scales and achieve structural and material complexity” explains Oxman. “Once we place a 3D printing head on a robotic arm we free up these limitations almost instantly.” In the future buildings may be constructed by swarms of tiny robots she says. “I would argue that 3D printing is more than anything an approach for organizing material. When considered in this way it is possible to move beyond the technology and its current limitations into larger scale constructions with geometrical and material complexity.” Oxman believes material limitations can be overcome by printing with responsive materials (which she calls “4D printing”); gantry limitations can be overcome by printing using multiple interactive robot-printers (“swarm construction”); and process limitations can be overcome by moving from layering to weaving in 3D space using a robotic arm (she calls this “CNC weaving”). Oxman believes that in the immediate future 3D printing in construction scales can only be successful if it is to challenge traditional construction techniques while being sensitive to cultural contexts. She adds: “Transcending the scale limitation by using larger gantries can only offer so much; but if we consider swarm construction or rebar-integrated printing we are truly pushing building construction into the 21stcentury”. Mediated Matter group research assistant Steven Keating is investigating these possibilities. The CNSilk Pavilion is being developed by the Mediated Matter group at the MIT Media Lab in collaboration with Professor Fiorenzo Omenetto atTUFTS University and Dr. James Weaver at the WYSS Institute at Harvard University. Researchers at the Mediated Matter Group developing this work include Markus Kayser Jared Laucks Carlos David Gonzalez Uribe Jorge Duro-Royo and Michal Firstenberg (Mediated Matter MIT Media Lab).

45319874572,2013-03-14 03:16:11 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45319874572/for-more-information-visit,audio, , ,For more information visit: http://www.klassikakzente.de/recomposed/home  Some works are so familiar that it is almost impossible to hear them afresh but that is what Max Richter has achieved with Vivaldi “Recomposed”. This is no mere arrangement; instead Richter has absorbed Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons into his own musical bloodstream. At first Richter followed the example of other works in the “Recomposed” series which re-mix existing recordings but he says “I wanted to open up the score on a note-by-note level and working with an existing recording was like digging a mineshaft through an incredibly rich seam discovering diamonds and not being able to pull them out. That became frustrating. I wanted to get inside the score at the level of the notes and in essence re-write it re-composing it in a literal way.”Richter calculates that in the process he has discarded around three-quarters of Vivaldi’s original. He opens with what he describes as “a dubby cloud which I’ve called Spring 0. It functions as a sort of prelude setting up an electronic ambient space for the first Spring movement to step into. I’ve used electronics in several movements subtle almost inaudible things to do withthe bass but I wanted certain moments to connect to the whole electronic universe that is so much part of our musical language today.” Other resonances are no less unexpected: Richter describes part of the first movement of his Summer as “heavy music for the orchestra. It’s relentless pulsed music which is a quality that contemporary dance music has; and perhaps I was also thinking about John Bonham’s drumming. Then in the second movement of Autumn I asked the harpsichordist Raphael Alpermann to play in what is a rather old-fashioned way very regularly rather like a ticking clock. That was partly because I didn’t want the harpsichord part to be attention-seeking but also because that style connects to various pop records from the 1970s where the harpsichord or Clavinet was featured including various Beach Boys albums and the Beatles’ Abbey Road.” Clearly Richter has brought his own frame of reference to the project. As he says “Vivaldi’s music is made of regular patterns and that connects with post-minimalism which is one strand in the music that I write. That felt like a natural link but even so it was surprisingly difficult to navigate my way through it. At every point I had to work out how much is Vivaldi and how much is me. It was difficult but also rewarding because the raw material is so fascinating.”Just as Richter’s Seasons plays tricks with the way we hear Vivaldi’s original so it also asks questions of the soloist Daniel Hope. “Violinists have Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons hardwired in their brain. Daniel is likely to play the original I don’t know how many times in a year and for him to have my parallel text going on in another part of his brain is a challenge. I think he did a wonderful job. He brought to it a deep engagement with the original but he was fully prepared to cut this new swathe through the text.”, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
45308517417,2013-03-14 00:54:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/45308517417/la-biennale-di-venezia-the-encyclopedic,photo, , ,La Biennale di Venezia - The Encyclopedic Palace On November 16 1955 self-taught Italian-American artist Marino Auriti filed a design with the U.S. Patent office depicting his Palazzo Enciclopedico (The Encyclopedic Palace) an imaginary museum that was meant to house all worldly knowledge bringing together the greatest discoveries of the human race from the wheel to the satellite.   Holed up in his garage out in the middle of the Pennsylvania countryside Auriti worked on his brainchild for years constructing the model of a 136-story building that would stand seven hundred meters tall and take up over sixteen blocks in Washington D.C.   Auriti’s plan was never carried out of course but the dream of universal all-embracing knowledge crops up throughout the history of art and humanity as one that eccentrics like Auriti share with many other artists writers scientists and self-proclaimed prophets who have tried—often in vain—to fashion an image of the world that will capture its infinite variety and richness.   These personal cosmologies with their delusions of omniscience shed light on the constant challenge of reconciling the self with the universe the subjective with the collective the specific with the general the individual with the culture of her time. Today as we grapple with a constant flood of information such attempts to structure knowledge into all-inclusive systems seem even more necessary and even more desperate. The 55th International Art Exhibition explores these flights of the imagination in a show that—like Auriti’s Encyclopedic Palace—combines contemporary artworks with historical artifacts and found objects.   With works spanning over the past century alongside several new commissions and with over one hundred and fifty artists from more than thirty-seven countries the exhibition is structured like a temporary museum that initiates an inquiry into the many ways in which images have been used to organize knowledge and shape our experience of the world.   Blurring the line between professional artists and amateurs outsiders and insiders the exhibition takes an anthropological approach to the study of images focusing in particular on the realms of the imaginary and the functions of the imagination. What room is left for internal images—for dreams hallucinations and visions—in an era besieged by external ones? And what is the point of creating an image of the world when the world itself has become increasingly like an image?The exhibition opens in the Central Pavilion with a presentation of Carl Gustav Jung’s Red Book an illustrated manuscript that the famous psychologist worked on for over sixteen years. A collection of visions epiphanies and hallucinations Jung’s Red Book ushers in a meditation on inner images and dreams that runs throughout the show.   The exhibition brings together many examples of artworks and figurative expressions that reveal approaches to visualizing knowledge through representations of abstract concepts and manifestations of supernatural phenomena. In the galleries of the Central Pavilion intertwined with works by contemporary artists are the abstract paintings of Hilma af Klint Augustin Lesage’s symbolic interpretations of the universe the divinations of Aleister Crowley and the apocalyptic premonitions of Friedrich Schröder-Sonnenstern. The ecstatic gift drawings of Shaker communities transcribe divine messages while the drawings of shamans from the Solomon Islands are peopled by deities and demons that battle sharks and other sea creatures. The depiction of the invisible is a key theme of the show as evidenced in the cosmographies of both Guo Fengyi and Emma Kunz in the religious icons and danses macabres of Jean-Frédéric Schnyder and in the video work by Artur Zmijewski who filmed a group of blind people painting a world they cannot see.  A similar sense of cosmic awe pervades many of the other works on display from Melvin Moti’s films to Laurent Montaron’s reflections on nature all the way to the sublime landscapes of Thierry De Cordier. The tiny ceramic dreamscapes of Ron Nagle the intricate floral patterns of Anna Zemánková the mental maps of Geta Bratescu and the painted palimpsests of Varda Caivano describe an inner world where natural forms overlap with imaginary presences. These secret links between microcosm and macrocosm also animate Marisa Merz’s hieratic figures and Maria Lassnig’s fleshly ones: both turn self-portraits and bodies into ciphers of the universe.  The exercise of the imagination through writing and drawing is a recurring motif in the exhibition. Christiana Soulou brings to life the imaginary beings catalogued by Jorge Luis Borges while José Antonio Suárez Londoño translates into images the diaries of Franz Kafka. The rare stones collection of French writer Roger Caillois combines geology with mysticism while the esoteric blackboard diagrams by pedagogue Rudolf Steiner feverishly relate the idealist dream of grasping and conveying the universe as a whole.   “The Encyclopedic Palace” is a show about obsessions and about the transformative power of the imagination. The alternative worlds dreamed up by artists as diverse as Morton Bartlett James Castle Peter Fritz and Achilles Rizzoli are displayed alongside Shinro Ohtake’s conglomerations of found images and Carl Andre’s visual autobiography. The dynamic tensions between inside and outside inclusion and exclusion are the subject of works that explore the role of imagination in prisons (Rossella Biscotti) and in psychiatric hospitals (Eva Kotatkova). Other places of confinement real or fanciful are depicted by Walter Pichler who spent most of his life—which sadly came to an end in 2012—creating habitats for his sculptures as if they were living creatures from another planet.  In the vast halls of the Arsenale the exhibition is organized as a progression from natural to artificial forms following the typical layout of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cabinets of curiosities. Just like Auriti’s Palace these baroque proto-museums brought together man-made and natural wonders to construct visual compendia of the world through a science of elective affinities and magical sympathies. This associative process of knowledge through its heterogeneous ordering of objects and images draws interesting parallels between the wunderkammer and today’s culture of hyper-connectivity.  Catalogues collections and taxonomies form the basis for many works on view including J.D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere’s photos Uri Aran’s installations Kan Xuan’s videos Shinichi Sawada’s bestiaries and Matt Mullican’s labyrinths. Pawel Althamer assembles a collective portrait with a series of eighty sculptures.   In the drawings of Stefan Bertalan Lin Xue and Patrick Van Caeckenbergh we find stubborn attempts to decipher the code of nature while the films of Gusmão and Paiva and photographs of Christopher Williams Eliot Porter and Eduard Spelterini examine ecosystems and landscapes with an infatuated gaze that longs to capture all the Earth’s spectacles large and small.  Yüksel Arslan illustrates the encyclopedia plates of an imaginary civilization that resembles a slightly warped version of humanity. The aspiration to create a magnum opus like Auriti’s Palace that can contain and describe everything flows through Arslan’s drawings as well as Robert Crumb’s visual chronicle of the Book of Genesis Frédéric Bruly Bouabre’s cosmogonies and the legends recounted by Papa Ibra Tall. Camille Henrot’s recent video work studies the creation myths of different societies while the hundred clay sculptures of Fischli and Weiss offer a wry antidote to the romantic excesses of such sweeping visions of human history.  Video works by Neïl Beloufa and Steve McQueen and paintings by Eugene Von Breunchenhein reflect various approaches to picturing the future while memory serves as the point of departure for Aurélien Froment Andra Ursuta and many other artists in the exhibition.  At the center of the Arsenale is a curatorial project by Cindy Sherman—a show within the show made up of over two hundred works by more than thirty artists—which creates an imaginary museum of her own devising. Dolls puppets mannequins and idols cohabit with photos paintings sculptures religious insignia and drawings by prison inmates which together compose an anatomical theater in which to contemplate the role of images in the representation and perception of the self.  Bodies and desires are also at the core of Hito Steyerl’s cinematic investigation of the culture of hyper-visibility and the latest documentary from Sharon Hayes which presents a remake of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s study of sexuality Comizi d’Amore. Ryan Trecartin’s volatile post-human bodies introduce the final section of the Arsenale where works by Yuri Ancarani Alice Channer Simon Denny Wade Guyton Channa Horwitz Mark Leckey Helen Marten Albert Oehlen Otto Piene James Richards Pamela Rosenkranz Stan VanDerBeek and others examine the blend of information spectacle and knowledge that is so characteristic of the digital era.  As a contrast to the white noise of the information age an installation by Walter De Maria celebrates the mute gelid purity of geometry. Like all works by this legendary artist—a pioneering figure in conceptual minimal and Land Art—this abstract sculpture is the result of complex numerological calculations—a self-contained system in which the endless possibilities of the imagination are reduced to an extreme synthesis.  Among the exhibition’s outdoor installations and performances—which include John Bock Ragnar Kjartansson Marco Paolini Erik van Lieshout and others and extend to the very end of the Arsenale in the Giardino delle Vergini—are works that take on and transform the sixteenth-century Venetian tradition of the Theatres of the World visual allegories of the cosmos in which actors and temporary architectures were used to construct representations of the universe.   Through these pieces and many other works on view “The Encyclopedic Palace” emerges as an elaborate but fragile construction a mental architecture that is as fantastical as it is delirious. After all the biennale model itself is based on the impossible desire to concentrate the infinite worlds of contemporary art in a single place: a task that now seems as dizzyingly absurd as Auriti’s dream.,art, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjml6l9NPU1s75lgto1_400.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The fabrics called Wooden Mesh were designed to transform wood into a soft and flexible material that behaves more like cloth Diego Vencato says.  Thin pieces of wood were cut into small shapes and applied evenly onto a felt backing.  The patterns include neatly ordered triangles sharply angled parallelograms and smooth-edged shapes that resemble a giraffe’s markings.  We’ve previously featured a carpet made from wood veneer offcuts and a T-shirt made from triangles of wood while Icelandic fashion designer Sruli Recht presented garments made of wood in the menswear collection he launched earlier this year.  Other textiles we’ve featured include an installation of hundreds of fabric ribbons and fabrics printed with bleach to spell out coded messages – see all textiles. Here’s some more information from the designer: Wooden Mesh by Diego Vencato A high-tech patented process to create the “wooden mesh” a compound which combines a rigid material to a flexible support. The wood goes through a metamorphosis process to become a new kind of skin.  Transforming wood making it possible that it not only could be flexible or soft but it could also behave exactly like a cloth was the idea behind the project.  To turn wood into fabric we had to break the continuity of its surface which we obtained by dividing it into pieces. Wood organised as in polygons was then coupled with the fabric which acts as a support and a binder at the same time.  This is how we created “Wooden Mesh” a compound – realised through a high-tech patented process – that combines a rigid material (parent material) to a flexible support (secondary material).  The goal was to move beyond the hand-crafted production to create an industrial product that had a more suitable cost for the market. This was possible thanks to the major contribution of Sintesi Laser and Alberto Martinuzzo founder of Albeflex and “father” of the soft wood. Now the two-dimensional surface of a piece of wood has been completely transformed to become as smooth and soft as fabric.  http://bit.ly/XshhUD,Dezeen,material,wood,Emilie Chalcraft, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjlwz1LFNS1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_9.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_1.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_2.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_5.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_6.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_12.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_10.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_8.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dezeen_Wooden-Mesh-by-Diego-Vencato_11.jpg, , , , , , , , , , ,

The pieces whose postures indicate they are either on their death bed or very close are punctured with thousands of holes and then embedded with powerful LED lights creating an effect much like the one you get from a planetarium. Ogaki is no stranger to morbid themes having analyzed the topic greatly in previous work. however this latest series is very much about life and the living individual. It is also the first time in her work that she uses the image of a human being. Life itself appears to radiate from the sculpture which at times almost appears to be a deity that holds the universe within it.     Born in Japan Ogaki went to art school in Japan. After graduating she moved to Germany where she spent over 10 years. In 2010 she returned to Japan and is currently based in Toride (Ibaraki prefecture). Ogaki’s work was most recently on display at “Arte Fiera Bologna 2013″ earlier this year.  source: colossal  http://bit.ly/YrUZMy,Spoon & Tamago,art,light,projection,Johnny, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjlwyygA5B1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YrUXEr,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YrUZMq,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YrUXUF,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:16s5ff8,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YrUZMt,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:16s5ffb,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:16s5cQm, , , , , , , , , , , , ,

In Japan there is no shortage of good food. After all Tokyo leads the world as the city with the most Michelin Three-Star restaurants. Now Japan is applying their technology to the culinary art of training. What a surprise today to discover that there is no more need for chefs to train their protege. The 3D simulator is the new teacher and teaches chefs-to-be everything they need to know.  The simulator calculates the heat transfer from the pan to the meat or vegetables that are being cooked and displays the visible changes caused by heating. The frypan interface allows for three-dimensional input and as well as moving the frying pan to aid the cooking process. The simulator can feed back the weight of the ingredients combined with the tactile feeling of frying them.  I guess that only thing it can’t do is simulate the smell of burnt food when you mess up. source: soon soon soon http://bit.ly/YaU97A,Spoon & Tamago,AR,technology,Justine, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjlwc7TnN31s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:ZKyZ3N, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But for the last decade the Chinese–who recently surpassed Americans as the biggest consumers of luxury goods–have picked up the mantle of logo-mania. But that may be changing now as the Chinese luxury customers’ taste is becoming a bit more discerning.

I’m enormously pleased to say that a book project long in the making will finally see the light of day later this month a collaboration between ACTAR and the Nevada Museum of Art called Landscape Futures: Instruments Devices and Architectural Inventions. On a related note I’m also happy to say simply despite the painfully slow pace of posts here on the blog going back at least the last six months or so that many projects ticking away in the background are at long last coming to fruition including Venue and now the publication of Landscape Futures.[Images: The opening spreads of Landscape Futures; book design by Everything-Type-Company].Landscape Futures both documents and continues an exhibition of the same name that ran for a bit more than six months at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno from August 2011 to February 2012. The exhibition was my first solo commission as a curator and by far the largest project I had worked on to that point. It was an incredible opportunity and I remain hugely excited by the physical quality and conceptual breadth of the work produced by the show’s participating artists and architects.  Best of all I was able to commission brand new work from many of the contributors including giving historian David Gissen a new opportunity to explore his ideas—on preservation technology and the environmental regulation of everyday urban space—in a series of wall-sized prints; finding a new genre—a fictional travelogue from a future lithium boom—for architects David Benjamin and Soo-in Yang of The Living in which to experiment; and setting aside nearly an entire room the centerpiece of the 2500-square-foot exhibition for an immensely complicated piece of functioning machinery (plus documentary photographs posters study-models an entire bound book of research and much else besides) by London-based architects Smout Allen a design duo I refer to often here on BLDGBLOG.  Those works joined pre-existing projects by Mason White & Lola Sheppard of Lateral Office and InfraNet Lab whose project “Next North/The Active Layer” explored the emerging architectural conditions presented by climate-changed terrains in the far north; Chris Woebken & Kenichi Okada whose widely exhibited “Animal Superpowers” added a colorful note to the exhibition’s second room; and architect-adventurer Liam Young who brought his “Specimens of Unnatural History” successfully through international customs to model the warped future ecosystem of a genetically-enhanced Galapagos. Needless to say I am absolutely thrilled with the incredible design work done by Everything-Type-Company—a new and rapidly rising design firm based in Brooklyn founded by Kyle Blue and Geoff Halber—and I am also over the moon to think that this material will finally be out there for discussion elsewhere. It’s been a long long time in the making.  In any case shipping should begin later this month. Hopefully the above glimpses and the huge list of people whose graphic textual or conceptual work is represented in the book will entice you to support their effort with an order.  Enjoy!(Thank you to all the people and organizations who made Landscape Futures possible including the Nevada Museum of Art and ACTAR supported generously by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Study in the Fine Arts the National Endowment for the Arts and the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts). http://bit.ly/XoqfT0,BLDGBLOG,architecture, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjkanxqTB41s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WkLYrY,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Zx8CuF,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WkLWA6, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

They shouldn’t for example show full news stories but only headlines as everything else would be too distracting. For longer stories developers can always just use Glass to read text to users. Essentially developers should make sure that they don’t annoy users with too many notifications and the data they send to Glass should always be relevant. Developers should also make sure that everything that happens on Glass should be something the user expects said Jordan. Glass isn’t the kind of device he said where a push notification about an update to your app makes sense.

But Ryoichi Kurokawa’s piece Oscillating Continuum shrinks this right back to create a hypnotic audiovisual sculpture set in a gallery space. Two screens housed in conjoined boxes show a horizontal red line that comes pulsing to life with the crackling audio as waves of abstract shapes and intricate linear patterns breakout across the white background. The piece’s minimalist setup causes the viewer to focus their attention even more than they would watching it on a stage making the sudden movements the splintered but detailed graphics and the eruption of seething forms even more startling. Much like Kurokawa’s other work the piece gives an almost tangible presence to the low humming drone and hiss of the music. @stewart23rd http://bit.ly/YnPE8P,The Creators Project,art, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjidwprwUJ1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:16muyPN, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

The microhome listed recently for $1200 boasts big windows a transparent roof a sleeping platform and perhaps its most valuable asset a New York Times mention. When the Times covered Deek and his backyard menagerie of rickshaws sleeping huts and forts the tiny lodge was dubbed “Gypsy Junker”—though it really looks nothing like Portland’s tiny gypsy mobile home nor the place Charles Dickens once called his “gypsy summer tent.” Deek is selling the cabin to make room on his Boston property for future projects which include a houseboat and a tiny house on wheels: “I actually don’t want to part with this so much but my yard is so small and I need to make way.” More below.

I had one particularly severe design professor who hated materials swapping for the sake of materials swapping. For example if you brought in a design for something ordinarily made of leather but spec’d it for steel and you couldn’t back up your reason for the materials choice he would excoriate you. “That’s not profound that’s not clever” he would rant. “The materials are supposed to serve the design not whimsy.” Still sometimes it’s fun (particularly when there’s no danger of an “F” looming over your head) to see videos like this one where materials experimentation is done just for the hell of it. To create a piece of “ride-able art” the guys at California-based Signal Snowboards visited some of Italy’s master glass manufacturers to see if a glass snowboard was do-able. The first stop was the Vetrerira Aurora glass factory in Brescia where the board is first cut and formed. (Who knew you could hot-bend and laminate multiple layers of glass together like a skate deck?) Stop two was glass magicians Viraver Technologies where the glass was tempered bonded and cooked. Then came the biq questions: How would it perform on ice hard pack powder?

Blessing Hancock and Joe O’Connell an artistic duo based in Tuscon Arizona have recently given the students of Texas State University a very large toy with which to play. As well as being a serious piece of art with an equally serious message it looks like great fun too.   Fish Bellies as the installation has been christened is created from a series of bolted acrylic sheets sculpted together to form a large biomorphic form. O’Connell and Hancock drew their inspiration from the nearby San Marcos River. The waterway is host to great biological diversity and the installation draws parallels between the life aquatic and the life academic.   Any and every university should be teeming with a miscellaneous not to mention motley student body in order to thrive and survive. And of course we all know that students can be different creatures when the sun goes down. Fish Bellies may look like a simple school of fish in the day time but when the evening draws in it is transformed in to a bioluminescent landscape.   That’s when the fun begins. O’Connell and Hancock have fitted the installation with touch sensitive technology. The students are able to control the internal LED structure by adjusting Fish Bellies’ color spectrum. In as much as it is meant to spark interest in the distinctive ecology and biology of the San Marcos River I am fairly sure it has earned any number of positive expressive comments in its own right.   http://bit.ly/WeTi8p,Kuriositas,architecture,light,noreply@blogger.com (RJ Evans), , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjg6qnMg9o1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeThRZ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkgD,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8f,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwR,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwT,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8j,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTi8l,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WeTkwV,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Y8yTS6, , , , , , , , , , ,

The concept apparel showcased at the search giant’s swanky SXSW Interactive headquarters is part of a new arts project - ”Art Copy Code” – which aims to breathe a social life-like experience into everyday objects. “If standing still was a sport you’d be world champion” the trash-talking shoe projects on a monitor hanging over a rainbow-colored obstacle course after it senses I’ve been standing still. At a distance users seem a tad pathetic trying to trigger positive feedback from the shoe. But when I strapped it on I felt oddly compelled to impress my new automated coach. Combining coaching (even robotic coaching) made lifeless data unexpectedly motivational. Essentially it’s Richards Simmons in a shoe. In case critics think this is another one of Google’s flights of profitless creative fancy Arts Copy Code is deliberately about improving advertising. “It’s explicitly aimed at how translating how Silicon Valley thinks about technology into how creative agencies think about advertising” says project lead Aman Govil. Brands such as Nike who outfit professional athletes with health-tracking shoes and bracelets could broadcast an athlete’s spring-training performance in realtime. Rival athletes’ apparel could trash talk one another automatically. It’s still (very) early days for the arts project. The talking shoe (and shoe strap) concept was developed through a grant to electronics agency Yes Yes No. Google plans to open up the project to more everyday objects in the near future. One hypothetical use-case imagines Govil is an alarm block that sends snarky messages to co-workers if users have to hit the snooze on their alarm clock more than three times. There’s been heightened attention to research that quantifies how much our friends affect our weight success and personal lives. University of San Diego political scientist and Connected author James Fowler found that having an obese friend can significantly increase people’s chances of also having their own set of marshmallowy love handles. And it’s no secret that a spirited friend can get us up at 5 a.m. for a morning run as much as they can tempt us into finishing their plate of fries. Health startups have attempted to “gamify” good behavior by encouraging users to share personal goals with friends. Nike+ FuelBand for instance shares users’ exercise habits with their friends on the personal social network Path. This project attempts to remove the barrier presented by current products. The social aspect has always required one extra step of human effort. However fast a one-word message of encouragement could take to type about a friend’s morning run the minor inconvenience is enough to seriously limit engagement. This new automated personality seems to have a place especially when we’re all too busy to be personal. Currently the project is just a concept. There’s no need to jump over to the Google Play store and find the buy link. But Google Glass was just a concept at one point too.

Using a Kinect and a standard DSLR camera like your Canon 5D these avant-garde image-makers have created a technique that allows you to map video from the SLR onto the Kinect’s 3D data to generate a true CGI and video hybrid. Why is this exciting? Well for one thing convincing CGI is incredibly difficult to do—it took the team behind Rockstar’sL.A. Noire a full 32 cameras and god knows how many man hours to record and digitally reconstruct their characters in 360 degrees. And while the experimental output from the RGB+D team is a far cry from those painstakingly constructed game visuals that’s kind of not the point. The point is the implications—this has the potential to change the way we think of 3D filmmaking and to significantly lower the barrier to entry using commercially available hardware and open source software. Today members of the RGB+D team—James George and Jonathan Minard—released the culmination of their research to date: an excerpt of an ongoing documentary project called Clouds that they’ve been developing alongside the RGB+D Toolkit their open source video editing application (which looks like a cross between Final Cut Pro and a video game engine). Clouds features interviews with prominent computer hackers media artists and critics discussing the creative use of code the future of data interfaces and computational visuals presented as a series of conversational vignettes.    An in-edit view of the Clouds documentary as seen in the RGB+D Toolkit edit timeline. “It is an infinite conversation a networked portrait an experiment in virtual cinema” explains Minard who works as a new media documentarian and is a fellow at Carnegie Mellon’s Studio for Creative Inquiry where he first joined forces with developer James George and recorded the first series of interviews for Clouds during the Art && Code conferencelast year. “The goal behind the documentary is to capture the creative hacker ethos in a media that suits the subject” explains George. “Clouds is a window into the mentality of the scene responsible for inventing the format that was used to create the film.” Which is probably why anyone who is familiar with the aesthetics of data visualization or has seen one of the countless Kinect hack demos from the past year will recognize influences of both in the film’s style. “The subjects float in a black void their figures composed of tiny points connected by lines that flicker and break apart at the edges” continues George. “They’re made out of pure computational matter—the same material the artists depicted work with on a daily basis.” Though they used a stationary one camera set-up the 3D Kinect data they capture allows them to render out the images any way they can dream up (and code up) and rephotograph their subjects from any angle in post production. “It starts to break down the notion that CGI and live action are different approaches to filmmaking and suggests the two will become so deeply entangled that we won’t be able to tell the difference anymore” says George. “This documentary and the toolkit put the potential of that merger front and center and show where it’s headed. But it’s always more interesting to create something from our imagination than to try to recreate reality. The true surprises are going to come from how we can reinterpret captured reality in ways that have never been seen before.” And that re-imagination of reality is precisely what the RGB+D team have started to play with in Clouds. Anyone who has ever worked with a Kinect knows that the capture is imperfect and incomplete. Accordingly the holographic-looking visages presented in Clouds have an eerie quality to them—spotty shaky slightly glitched out and blurred as if they’re being broadcast from far far away through a weak transmission signal. Nevertheless it’s precisely this factor that makes it so arresting. There’s something about it (perhaps the black void in the background perhaps the sound design) that has the feel of a deep space or deep sea exploration film. The viewer has the sensation of voyaging into the unknown and discovering strange but beautiful creatures there. The interspersed elements of visual abstraction where the talking head suddenly breaks apart into a point of glittering dots or undulating wireframes serve not only as representations of things being discussed in the dialogue but as experimental filmic gestures that hint at an emerging new aesthetic that the RGB+D team is only beginning to cultivate.    A sampling of the visual treatments being explored by the RGB+D team in the Clouds documentary. The project is continuing to evolve as the team travels around to creative coding conferences to conduct more interviews. In addition to Art && Code they captured a large portion of interviews at Resonate Festival in Belgrade this March and are preparing for another of fresh scans at the upcoming EyeO festival. The editing software is constantly getting spruced up too with support from Eyebeam Art + Technology center in NYC and the Studio for Creative Inquiry in Pittsburgh. We caught up with the filmmakers via email to learn more about their plans for the film and the RGB+D Toolkit. What was the goal in developing the RGB+D toolkit and the documentary itself?James: The goal behind the toolkit is to capture our aesthetic research and make discoveries repeatable. We’ve been working with the Kinect+SLR technique since Alexander Porter and I first experimented in the NYC subway with a sensor rubber-banded to an SLR. Every time we do a new project the tool grows. Because everyone involved has different backgrounds it’s super important that the tool can be used by people who aren’t programmers so everything is controlled through a graphical user interface. Jonathan: As a documentary filmmaker with a background in new media art and anthropology I am interested in stories of invention and discovery: how people develop new tools and how those tools shape the collective imagination. This project has all those elements. It’s no coincidence that this documentary realized in a computational format explores the subject of code and culture. Form should reflect content. A principle feature of this project is that it’s a documentary about media art in which the movie is itself a new media experiment. Why did you choose to release it open source as opposed to developing a proprietary software/technique?James: If everyone can do it no one can own it and it becomes part of the world of visual culture rather than any individual artist’s personal aesthetic. We could try to be protective of our techniques but we’d end up becoming a one-trick pony. It’s much more interesting to release the app and watch it run wild. Jonathan: What’s most exciting about this new technique is that it’s so young and formless and malleable as a medium. As it evolves we can include our friends in the process of collectively imagining what it might become. This I have learned is one of the benefits of open source coding: software is never finished it can always be improved extended and reinvented. As long as this medium stays alive there’s no limit to where it might go. Tell me a little about the mood and feel you were hoping to establish with the aesthetic treatment you’ve given the data?Jonathan: In the opening scene of Clouds Philip (@underdoeg) emerges from a chaos of particles in a digital void and says “With coding you can do whatever you want… it’s like there’s nothing in the beginning and then you start throwing things in there.” It felt appropriate to open the film with a metaphorical cosmogenesis. We play with the idea that coders become gods by creating digital universes from nothing. The virtual actors reside in a slippery zone between form and formlessness. We wanted to establish their immateriality acknowledging the fact that they are not solid beings but information objects assembled from nothing more than clouds of 3D pixels in a frameless black box. James: We wanted the tone to land somewhere between quirky and cosmic—an approximation of what it’s like to hang out with a creative programmer for a day. The treatment we’ve given the data is reflexively raw and humble. We are working with points lines and triangles—the basic building blocks of real-time 3D graphics. The effects we use to augment the narration are simple code tricks like Perlin particle systems basic noise and sine wave generators. We are exposing the format’s raw elements to educate the audience to our visual language. At the same time we are relating the cultural mentality. This is the start of the process I think the flashy stuff will come next.    Creative coders J.T. Nimoy (top) and Marcus Wendt (bottom) rendered as abstract wireframed figures. How do you hope to continue developing this project? What are the next steps for you?Jonathan: The project is a journey an exploration to see how far we can go toward developing a new aesthetic of cinema with tools at our disposal. What began as a design fiction—imaging the camera of the future—has come closer and closer to a real thing. And yet it remains an intermediate format aspiring toward something so amazing that we can only vaguely describe what it looks and feels like. To understand this imagined future of cinema and its ontological impact watch David Cronenberg’s film eXistenZ or read Philip K Dick. James: The big picture idea is to create an infinite conversation. An interactive application to navigate clouds of related thoughts taken from many conversations. Sending a query to our cloud will result in a stream of figurative points clouds speaking to the subject. We imagine this working in a real-time environment where the viewer can control the camera and choose who to listen to by flying through space virtually. Something like a WebGL or an iPad app seems like a suitable platform to execute this idea. We are exploring both. What’s most exciting about this new technique for you?James: I’ve always felt torn between trying to make visuals using pure code versus using video sources. When I first saw the sizzling point clouds the Kinect generated I knew that dichotomy had ended. The technique lets us capture figurative imagery that of people and gestures and break it down into rich purely generative material like a particle system. There is intrinsic poetry in the idea that we are composed of a collection of swarming points and having a technique that lets the viewer swim between figuration and abstraction is an imagination playground. Jonathan: What resulted has exceeded our expectations. The emergence of a new cinematic medium obliterating the divide between computer graphics and video. It looks like nothing we have seen before and forecasts previously unimagined possibilities. How do you hope to see this technique used in filmmaking down the line? What are the potential applications of it that have yet to be explored?Jonathan: We have not yet attempted to compose scenes with multiple independent objects that were recorded separately. It would be possible to construct an entire scene virtually—to stage a conversation between multiple actors recorded in different spaces at different times—however the current software doesn’t enable real-time compositing of more than one pointcloud. This is achievable but we haven’t worked on anything yet where it became necessary. James: We’ve been experimenting with giving the data back to the artists and have them to reinterpret the data as a self portrait. We hope to be publishing the results of some of that experimentation soon. When we introduce someone to the technique the unanimous first reaction is to add more sensors to create a full reconstruction of the scene. The data suggests its own potential to be filled out completely.

They have used their year in the spotlight to expose injustice Depending on how you define it the most important performance by a rock band in 2012 lasted either less than two minutes or a full nine days.Pussy Riot’s guerrilla rendition of Punk Prayer: Mother of God Drive Putin Away in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour Moscow on 21 February was brief even by punk standards and less striking and significant to non-Russian eyes than the band’s rooftop appearance in Red Square a month earlier. But the vindictive trial that ensued was a major international media event which revealed both the depth of the defendants’ courage and intelligence and the power of popular music to illuminate a political situation. At a recent House of Commons event organised by Kerry McCarthy MP who attended the trial the musician and critic John Robb suggested that the church gig was merely the soundcheck and the trial was the real show. Contrary to Putin’s sneering remark that “they got what they asked for” Maria Alyokhina Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Yekaterina Samutsevich didn’t set out to get prosecuted. A shrewder less authoritarian government would have stayed its hand and let interest in the group peter out instead of breaking a butterfly on a wheel with a prosecution that reprised the tragedy of Communist show trials as farce. Once they were granted a platform that they had never sought the three women with admirable clarity and dignity used it to put their accusers on trial. “The Russian authorities took a marginal act of arty protest and through sheer cruelty made it into an international cause” wrote Michael Idov the editor-in-chief of GQ Russia adding that coverage of the trial amounted to “long infomercials against investing in visiting and generally dealing with Russia”. Tobi Vail whose early 90s Riot Grrrlband Bikini Kill was one of Pussy Riot’s inspirations wasn’t being too hyperbolic when she called them “The only band that matters in 2012.” What Pussy Riot understand so keenly is Allen Ginsberg’s observation in the 1960s that “national politics was theatre on a vast scale with scripts timing sound systems. Whose theatre would attract the most customers whose was a theatre of ideas that could be gotten across?” Viewed purely as a pop group they are faultless: the unforgettable name whose punchy collision of sex and violence is a feminised radicalised take on the Sex Pistols; the uniform of bright dresses and balaclavas which makes them both memorable and anonymous; the terse splenetic punk racket; the unlicensed occupation of public spaces for their performances and their subsequent dissemination on social media. In her closing statement to the court Tolokonnikova said: “We were searching for real sincerity and simplicity and we found these qualities in the holy foolishness of punk.” Although their unusually tight post-trial release Putin Lights Up the Fires is as strong as many Riot Grrrl records Pussy Riot are like only a handful of western bands – Crass Public Enemy the Last Poets – political provocateurs first and musicians second. They make words image and noise tell the same story so that you can see them in action for one minute and still get the message. Some seasoned Russia-watchers have grumbled about young women in colourful balaclavas receiving immeasurably more international attention than other persecuted dissidents. They might as well complain that rain is wet. Pussy Riot are clever and committed enough to express themselves in more sober ways if they wanted but they chose to exploit the media to the hilt because they know how it works – in the words of 60s Yippie activist Abbie Hoffman they “fight through the jungles of TV”. Their fame has not eclipsed other injustices in Russia but highlighted them in the tradition of opposition movements strategically promoting charismatic individuals from Nelson Mandela to Ai Wei Wei as synecdoches for an entire cause. For newly curious observers outside Russia Pussy Riot have lifted the curtain on the regime’s intolerance. There is nothing accidental about this and nothing trivial about the women themselves. We are used to musicians making inspiring protest songs then fumbling the follow-up as they try to paper over the gaps in their knowledge with stirring simplifications. Not Pussy Riot. They sprang in October 2011 from the anarchist art collective Voina(meaning “war”) with an arsenal of political theory. The scope of their concerns is broad from education and healthcare to feminism LGBT rights and Russia’s culture of conformity. Two of them were arrested for taking part in Moscow’s banned Gay Pride rally last year. Their concerts by laying claim to public spaces are Situationist-inspired acts of dissent even before a note has been played. It’s perhaps misleading to call them a band. The five who performed in the cathedral (two fled the country to avoid arrest) are only part of a shifting collective that numbers up to 20. Tolokonnikova sees their work as “modern art”. Samutsevich told Rolling Stone: “Art has become only more complicated. Now it’s done internationally and it has great political potential. An artist is a person who is constantly analysing critical thoughts always working out an independent opinion regarding everything. That is why art gives a breath of fresh air and a different way to protest.” So when the prosecution depicted them as Satanic hooligans and their defence team complained Samutsevich “made us look like teenage girls that went against Putin without even understanding why they are … doing it” the trio proved themselves to be calm courageous impeccably well-informed women whose eloquent statements to the court quoted Dostoevsky Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Brodsky. “Compared to the judicial machine we are nobodies and we have lost” said Samutsevich. “On the other hand we have won … The system cannot conceal the repressive nature of this trial. Once again the world sees Russia differently than the way Putin tries to present it at his daily international meetings.” Even some members of Putin’s United Russia party agreed with one publicly complaining the indictment “makes the country the laughing stock of the entire world.”,fashion,art,1990s,grunge,feminism,activism, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjf5pqMZES1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

August 08 1996|ROBIN GIVHAN | THE WASHINGTON POST The fashion industry thrives on the twitchy anticipation of style junkies searching for their next hit. It has gotten high on glamorous buxom beauties and tripped on the vapid waif generation. Among the current addictions is a nihilistic vision of beauty that mirrors the wasted silhouettes and pinched faces of drug addicts. This explains why Bob Dole recently jumped on the fashion world for sending “a false and deadly message to America’s youth that drugs are harmless fun.” Magazine readers have seen this gloomy look in the dark-rimmed vacant eyes of models. Editors and photographers have been fond of posing them in dingy bathrooms or cheap motels with their makeup smeared and their hair tousled. And while they may be wearing the latest pricey designer clothes the implication is that a hypodermic is somewhere just outside of the frame. In March when the British fashion collections were unveiled in London the International Herald Tribune reported: “Two movies are currently defining British society: ‘Trainspotting’ a gutsy gaunt and surreal story of Scottish heroin junkies and ‘Sense and Sensibility.’ “ Fashion has mostly opted to embrace the junkies. Their style is called heroin chic.

The event was staged in the ruins of Linlithgow Palace near Edinburgh in Scotland. SEE THE FULL SHOW PICTURES HERE “Karl’s interpretation of traditional Scottish dress was exquisite and imaginative and to say the setting was magical is a huge understatement” she told us this morning. “It was one of those evenings where you just felt so privileged to be there.” Unsurprisingly tartan and tweed were key themes - as worn by Cara Delevingne Stella Tennant and Edie Campbell on a catwalk that encircled medieval-inspired baskets of fire. Guests sat underneath a wooden awning as the show took place with refreshments in the form of hot ginger and whiskey to help ensure no one felt the snowy weather. Afterwards an exclusive dinner was held overlooking a nearby loch - at which six bagpipers provided the evening’s soundtrack before British musician Jake Bugg performed. The luxury fashion house has had a long-standing love for Scotland. Coco Chanel had always used Scottish wool in her creations but her fascination with the country was heightened when she started a romantic relationship with the Duke of Westminster in 1924. The pair would often visit his numerous estates in the Scottish Highlands occasionally joined by Winston Churchill. The tweed jackets and Fairisle jumpers that the Duke wore to go hunting and fishing during these breaks inspired the designer’s work for years to come.

Or as James Truman then-editor of Details magazine said in 1992 “It’s unfashion. …Grunge is about not making a statement which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.…Buying grunge from Seventh Avenue is ludicrous.” So grunge wasn’t fashion but it was undeniably a style one that was spawned in and around Seattle before the logging and fishing industries were decimated from the days when it was common to see flannel-clad lumberjacks and crabbers putting a dent in their fat paychecks at the dive bars where Bed Bath & Beyond and Abercrombie & Fitch stores now stand. The warm layered and inexpensive style that suited the Northwest working-class was adopted by the flood of musicians drifting into town. Even the growing tribe of nerds that used funny words like “high tech” and “dot-com” dropped cash on comfy fleece wool and Goretex at outdoor outfitters like Filson Pendleton and REI. By the early 1990s Seattle was quite probably the worst dressed town with the best music scene in the world. And then on this day in 1992 during New York Fashion Week Perry Ellis designer Marc Jacobs introduced his now-notorious Spring ‘93 grunge-inspired collection and turned a no-nonsense efficient style of dressing into a national joke. On one hand Jacobs nailed the look. Midriffs were bare dresses were baggy and printed with granny flowers flannel shirts were tied around waists and combat boots fit every foot. Except Jacobs’ “flannel” shirts were in fact sand-washed silk and his “polyester” dresses were diaphanous chiffons. Three-figure price tags were slapped on clothes that intentionally tried to look polyester. Paying homage to pop culture is nothing new in the fashion world. Details editor Truman’s “ludicrous” remark comes into play though when you figure in that this all occurred during the height of a recession when the average Seattle barista had a Masters degree andbought thermal undershirts second hand at Goodwill. To boot grunge culture was also at its peak and there was no shortage of authentic flannel to be had for a song. Ludicrous indeed. Fashion critic Bernadine Morris described Jacobs’ collection as “mixing everything up. …A typical outfit looks as if it were put together with the eyes closed in a very dark room.” But she was quick to applaud his smart choice of decidedly anti-grunge fabrics ones that had “no air of the ashcan hovering over them.” It was one thing to look like a poverty-stricken teenage musician and quite another to feel—or smell—like one. The following day of Fashion Week Anna Sui introduced her own homage to grunge although her take was a bit more flower-child hippie and young designer Christian Francis Roth sent out an even more gentrified version with ultra-soft leggings peeking out from shirts gently tied around waists. Jacobs who admitted to never having been to Seattle triumphed in the grunge trifecta not because his collection was the best but because Women’s Wear Daily hailed him the “guru of grunge.” Back in Seattle the same musicians and hangers-on who inspired the look collectively threw up in their pitchers of beer (probably necessary disclaimer time: I moved to Seattle in 1992 at age 21 and was definitely in the eye-rolling crowd). To them (us) most of whom struggled to make ends meet the capitalization of a thrift-store style was about as classy as championing “homeless chic” or fashion inspired by a devastating natural disaster. And sure there was the personal indignation that occurs whenever an outsider “discovers” something low-end and exploits it into something saccharine and inauthentic. Still the rockers weren’t alone: Word of the grunge collections spread overnight with newscasters collapsing into giggles over collections that seemed like a real-life enactments of Qui Êtes-Vous Polly Maggoo?. From a public relations perspective the fashion world couldn’t have seemed more out of touch. (To put it in perspective imagine a young designer today say Christian Siriano creating his next collection based on Twilight.) Yet the following February Jacobs got a standing O when he received the CFDA Designer of the Year Award as presented by Christy Turlington while Linda Evangelista handed the Perry Ellis Award for New Fashion Talent to Anna Sui. Galvanized Jacobs announced a week later that he was leaving Perry Ellis and launching his own label one that would be underwritten by his former employer. What he didn’t mention is that the grunge collections didn’t sell. In late February the New York Times reported “Though [Jacobs] had delivered a much-discussed and much-photographed grunge-inspired collection for spring the board of Perry Ellis International did not foresee ever making money on his women’s wear… and decided to stop producing the unprofitable women’s collection that Mr. Jacobs had been designing for four years [since founder Perry Ellis’ death from AIDS].” Walter Thomas then the creative director at J.Crew nailed it when he said “By the time you see [a trend] in Kmart it can be three years [after it first hit the catwalk]. The difference with grunge is that it was already for sale at Kmart not to mention the Salvation Army.” So of course no one bought Seventh Avenue grunge when the real thing could be had for a song. A year later Kurt Cobain died. The recession lifted and an economic boom took place. Thrifting was no longer a necessity. Seattle was seen as passé and the fashion world sniggered over the dreadful era of grunge and hoped everyone would forget about it. Then a few years ago a change in attitude occurred. Fashion blogs primarily helmed by women in their early 20s began digging back into history and took a hankering to the styles of the late 1980s and early 90s. The work of Anna Sui and poor Christopher Francis Roth rarely get a nod but Marc Jacobs’ collection is hailed as genius. And admittedly even strangely today Jacobs’ clothes look like a fresh take on an old classic. Perhaps he should have waited a few years to commemorate a culture that was not yet out of style. —Ali BasyePhotos: Top second to the bottom and bottom are by Steven Meisel for Vogue December 1992.

The social and economic landscape of the early ’90s was a cultural turning point both nationally and globally. Conflict in Europe attempts at peace in the Middle East the AIDS crisis national debates on health care gun control and gay rights and caustic partisan politics were both the background and source material for a number of younger artists who first came to prominence in 1993. This exhibition brings together a range of iconic and lesser-known artworks that serve as both artifacts from a pivotal moment in the New York art world and as key markers in the cultural history of the city. “NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set Trash and No Star” draws its subtitle from the eponymous album that the New York rock band Sonic Youth recorded in 1993 and captures the complex exchange between mainstream and underground culture across disciplines which came to define the art of the era. The exhibition takes a broad view of the New York scene as it existed twenty years ago—focusing not only on a single generation of emerging New York artists but also looking at more senior figures and individuals from other cities who had some of their first significant exhibitions in New York in 1993. Works that are immediately recognizable from major institutional presentations like the Whitney Biennial and Venice Biennale are presented alongside lesser-known works which may have initially only been seen by a small audience in commercial galleries alternative spaces or in the artist’s studio. This exhibition is not a definitive history of the art in the 1990s nor is it one that privileges a single group of artists united under a single thematic or conceptual banner. Instead the exhibition takes the form of a kind of vertical cross section of artistic production in New York City—capturing both the familiar and the forgotten and bringing together individuals who may have originally inhabited radically different positions. The critical debates and discussions of the early 1990s—on issues such as racial and gender politics globalism and institutional critique—have been taken up again in recent years by younger artists writers activists and filmmakers demonstrating how our current social and political moment grows out of the events and ideas of the recent past. Many of the artists in the exhibition have only recently become prominent and although others may seem less familiar to a contemporary audience all the participants have contributed to the complex intersection between art and the world at large that defined the 1990s and continues to shape artistic expression today. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with key historical texts and reflections by younger curators and writers on the impact of this pivotal moment in American culture.

In true Hadid-fashion the Changsha Meixihu International Culture & Arts Center defines itself by extreme sinuous curves that radiate from each of the three independent structures and links them to a pedestrianized landscape that offers a “strong urban experience” forming what they hope to be a global destination for theater and art. More on the cultural and arts center after the break…   The International Culture & Arts Centre embodies a unique variety of civic nodes and spaces: A Grand Theatre a Contemporary Art Museum a Multipurpose Hall and supporting facilities. The central plaza is generated by the relative position of these separate buildings and offers a strong urban experience whereby the flow of pedestrian visitors that come from all sides of the site intersect and meet. In parallel it also stretches outwards to the neighboring streets with unfettered and phenomenal views across Meixi lake with access towards Festival Island.  The Grand Theatre is the focal point of the Changsha International Culture & Arts Centre. It is the largest performance venue in the city with a total capacity of 1800 seats. Designed to host world-standard performances the building contains will contain all the necessary front of house functions such as lobbies cloakrooms bars restaurants and VIP hospitality as well as the required ancillary functions such as administration rehearsal rooms backstage logistics dressing and make-up rooms and wardrobe.  The Museum’s composition of three fluid petals around its internal central atrium juxtaposes of the various patchworks of gallery spaces in a truly seamless fashion. With outward views and balconies to its exteriors it aims to engage the site’s unique location and surrounding views into some of its gallery spaces. An external plaza which faces Meixi Lake Road allows for outdoor sculptures exhibitions and events to be extended to an expansive outdoor space.  The Small Theatre (Multipurpose Hall) is characterized by its flexibility. With a maximum capacity of 500 seats it can be adapted and transformed to different configurations. It can therefore accommodate a broad range of functions and shows that span from banquets and commercial events to small plays fashion shows and music. A commercial attraction this venue shares seamless public access to retail areas and restaurant facilities which are seated in an open and gently sunken courtyard linking visitors to and from the basement level.  Although these civic institutions are uniquely defined and separate they supply each other in all respects within its setting with plazas offering visitors a tapestry-like sequence of urban ambiances that relate to the different institutions inject the site with urban vitality. The working hours of the different venues also overlap to ensure continuity during the full 24 hour cycle; Operated during the evening the Grand Theatre becomes active as the Museum begins to conclude its day- time operations whilst the Small theatre and retail/restaurants would be commercially available day and night. In this regard they benefit from each other’s vicinity ensuring that the site is lively 24 hours a day. This dynamic composition further establishes a powerful relationship with its surroundings which confers monumentality to the ensemble. Embodying values of functionality elegance and innovation the Changsha Meixi Lake International Culture & Arts Center aims to become the new cultural and civic node for the city of Changsha and well as global cultural destination.

The modular project concentrates on customizable space with the aim of not only to create various purposes of space but to reflect the theatre performing motion and spirit to the pavilion. Inspired by the dancing or performance motion captured in time the project’s facade represents the abstract act and movement of the performance of the theatre. More images and architects’ description after the break.   The motion itself is created by series of mountain climbing ropes installation weaved together forming a facade. The illusion of the elegant abstract movement is a result of the way of weaving the ropes between top and bottom fixing then the intersection of the weaving will travel as you move.  The rounded shape of WIT pavilion provides a unique experience of a timeless journey and also on the other side it gives a certain transparency from direct visual angle and helps to reinforce the motion at other angle. Beside the ropes featuring as a facade from a distance it also allows a certain level of transparency towards to the exhibition space as people walks closer to the pavilion. It leaves a curiosity behind the emotional movement.  Capturing motion in time is a dynamic language of abstract movement and pattern. This language is introduced on the geometry and also the facade system in order to give sense of fluidity continuity and lightness. Like a dance it is performed in many cultures as a form of emotional expression social interaction or exercise in a spiritual or performance setting and is sometimes used to express ideas or tell a story. It lies an emotion behind the movement which is re-interpreted by a method of weaving.  Weaving is a method of fabric production in which two distinct sets of yarns or threads are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric or cloth. A fabric is made to cover or protect your body and it has to be soft to the skin. Besides that it needs certain porosity for air ventilation to your body. The blend of inter-relationship between the motion and the softness of weaving creates a emotional tension which creates a level of dynamic movement through a visual illusion.

The prosthetic was constructed using an additive printing process and was implanted following manufacturer Oxford Performance Materials receiving FDA approval to use the technology last month. News.com.au reports that the company can create similar implants in two weeks after receiving 3D scans of a patient’s injured area. It believes that 500 people in the US each month could take advantage of the new process. The implant is made of polyetherketoneketone a biocompatible polymer that won’t interfere with X-rays. Small details are etched along the surface of the prosthetic to promote the growth of bone and cells. This is the first additively manufactured polymer implant to receive approval by the FDA. Reports on the new surgery are unclear on whether it was 75 percent of the skull’s surface area or the skull’s mass that was replaced however we believe that it’s likely to be the latter. Because the implant doesn’t have to be tooled and can be created directly from a digital file the company reports that there are few limits on what it can make.

View all  Maybe inspired by Nicole Scherzinger’s LED Twitter dress Barbie’s latest techno-clothing – which recently debuted at the New York Toy Fair – can be illuminated by 114 tri-color LEDs. The dress is controlled by a 4.5 square inch (29 sq cm) resistive touch panel which can be drawn on with fingers or an included pink (naturally!) stylus. Different modes – which are selected by buttons on Barbie’s heart necklace – give users the ability to play a series of ready-to-go graphics like hearts and fireworks or draw custom animated designs after selecting their colors of choice. A third mode sees graphics on the dress respond to music and sounds.

Thousands of unique components were 3D printed in a flowing mesh designed exactly to fit Dita’s body.  This represents the possibility to 3D print complex customized fabric like garments designed exactly to meet a specific person or need.  As we see the material properties of 3D printing mature to produce more fine flexible materials we will see more and more forays into fashion such as this.  At first it is at the boundaries of haute couture and art but as we have seen with Nike using 3D printing in footwear we will see more and more 3D printing creep into the world of clothing and fashion until it becomes ubiquitous.    We would like to extend a massive thanks to the entire team at the Ace Hotel in New York for organizing the collaboration and an amazing event. It is these collaborations between designers and 3D modeling specialists that push the boundaries of what is possible with 3D printing.   At Shapeways we receive a constant stream of inquiries from artists designers and advertising agencies from around the world looking to connect with 3D modeling experts to help them bring their ideas to reality with 3D printing.  If you are a 3D modeling expert interested in helping others realize their ideas with 3D printing post your availability in the 3D modelers for hire thread in the Shapeways forums and you may be the next 3D modeling craftsperson blinking into the flashing lights of the paparazzi on stage. Thanks again to the Ace Hotel Michael Schmidt Francis Bitonti Dita Von Teese and the entire Shapeways team that made this possible.  Thanks to the Ace Hotel and Albert Sanchez for images.  ,fashion,material, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mjaxwoQgT41s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:dita_Von_Teese_3D-printed_gown_shapeways_674.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:3D-Printed_gown_detail.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:3dprintedgownrear.jpg,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:groupshot3dprinteddress.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Too Close to Call Yesterday I published the first question of my driving direction survey showing an extremely fragmented market. It is a category led by Google but one that is fragmented and after a long period of calm is once again becoming heated. Apple with the release of their own mapping product in September has quickly garnered market share and has created a playbook that others like Samsung could very well follow. After Apple’s disastrous rollout where their mapping product was widely criticized (ah the problems of a market leader) life has settled in. I wanted to see 6 months in how Apple Maps was fairing in the competition for iPhone users and how many users were actively using products other than Apple’s. Using Google survey I created a filter question to ascertain their preferred device/software for driving directions. Five hundred users that indicated iPhone as the answer were asked this follow up question: What mapping or driving directions app do you use most often on your iPhone? The answer? Its a statistical dead heat with Google Maps for the iPhone showing a lead that is well within the margin of error of the survey.  What does this mean for Apple and Google? The survey doesn’t really address whether the users still using Apple Maps are happy or just victioms of inertia. My anecdotal reports would indicate the former that many are very happy with the product but I don’t have hard data to back that up. Apple in releasing a product before it was fully ready opened themselves up to plenty of criticism. More importantly they have yet to learn how to play defense well in an all too combative market that will take any opportunity to go after the market leader. Apple has a solid market share and more importantly critical real estate. They have a product that is easy to use and very attractive. They seem to be willing to do what it takes to make Apple Maps a long term contender. Google a hyper competitive player will (or should I say has) move into their release often upgrade features till the other side gets tired strategy. Yesterday after only two months on the market they released a fairly significant upgrade to their iPhone Google Maps product. As Googler Joel Headley noted on Google + yesterday in response to my survey: It’s great to see a number of players that have great apps. I know it will help focus Google to develop new and exciting things in mapping not thought of by other folks.  Google not used to second place in the mapping space seems willing to invest resources in regular and frequent upgrades to their iPhone app (even while Their Places Product is burning). Mapquest an early entrant into the iPhone driving directions market with an excellent product lost a tremendous opportunity to gain visibility both before the Apple Maps release and in its aftermath. I am not sure how they missed their chance. They too could have been a contender and one has to wonder exactly what they were thinking during the fiasco. The many bit players like the telco products will never achieve lift off velocity. Waze seems to have moved on with Apple’s entry. It does seem to be a two horse race. Like I said yesterday “driving directions long a stable and somewhat boring market is once again in play”. The advent of mobile platforms has injected vitality and change into a market that needed just that. Note: See yesterday’s post for methodology and issues related to the survey results that might impact the results.

In the evening Maison Michel (hats bunny ears headbands cool girls IT girls naughty girls - you get the drift) also had their blogger’s event.  Complete with champagne cakes and tea and of course trying on the new collection.  Not sure if it’s a Maison Michel first but it’s certainly a far cry from when I got yelled at for taking pictures in a Maison Michel showroom a few years back.  Suddenly it’s all “What can I do for you?”  Remembering how it was back in the day mean it’s easier to take it all with a pinch of salt or in this case - a pair of lacy bunny ears.  Grandma blogging observations aside the collection is as ever alluring coquettish and undeniably pretty.  You’ve got speckled dotty and spray-painted hats sometimes with leather brims sometimes with chains.  The headbands get the rose-gold treatment and the plastic teddy bear eared caps get rained on with silicone droplets.  All good stuff for bulbous-headed folk like myself.  Maison Michel’s designs have the tendency to get ripped off fast and in a poor manner and of course bloggers have done their DIY versions in the past.  It’s most likely to be a “If you can’t beat em’ join em’” approach.  Show us the real thing and then comes the open dialogue.  Times-a-changing indeed.                             http://bit.ly/Yy3Hvw,Style Bubble,March 06,fashion,hats,materials,susie_bubble, , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj8vjwr8Wr1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:12tWmCG,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3JmX,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3JmZ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Hf0,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Jn3,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Jn5,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Hf2,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Jn9,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Hf4,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3Hvi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3JDv,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3JDB,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:Yy3JDD,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:12tWpOC,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:12tWphI, , , , ,

Ross wrote: “I’m leaving because a Forbes writer asked his son’s best friend Todd if Facebook was still cool and the friend said no and plus none of HIS friends think so either even Leila who used to love it and this journalism made me reconsider the long-term viability of the company.” A few sentences later Ross wrote “In all seriousness even after switching to part-time at Facebook it’s just time for me to try new things” but the damage was done. Ross has since removed the letter perhaps because he’d accidentally posted it publicly or because his jesting intro wasn’t taken as lightly as he’d hoped. The “journalism” Ross mentioned is hardly Pew Research but it means something. Facebook admitted in its annual 10-K report that it might be losing “younger users” to “other products and services similar to or as a substitute for Facebook.” Teens are often an accurate barometer for what’s cool and what’s next and recent rumblings seem to indicate teens are moving on. Telling your colleagues that teens are no longer into your product is far from an Irish goodbye. Teenspeak When Branch co-founder Josh Miller asked his fifteen-year-old sister what was hot she said Facebook had gone cold. “She tries to visit Facebook as infrequently as possible” Miller wrote because it’s addictive and because it’s not as fun as Instagram. “Facebook may have an irreversibly bad brand” Miller concluded. But what if it’s not about brand but about the changing definition of what’s fun and addictive online? Perhaps more importantly the community on Facebook and the culture of the web is changing and privacy is starting to trump sharing for young users. WHAT IF IT’S NOT ABOUT BRAND BUT ABOUT THE CHANGING DEFINITION OF WHAT’S FUN AND ADDICTIVE ONLINE? “I think it has less to do with kids consciously looking for ‘the next big thing’ than Facebook just no longer being a space that serves them” says Laura Portwood-Stacer author of “Media Refusal and Conspicuous Non-Consumption: The Performative and Political Dimensions of Facebook Abstention”. “I think kids are less self-conscious about trying to be cool than marketers would like to think” she said. When Facebook launched it was cool to expose details about yourself like what movies you like what you’re doing right now and who you’re in a relationship with. It was dare I say exhilarating — being able to share freely with the world without having to learn how to code or even how to apply a MySpace theme. At some point adding these details like hundreds of photos from a recent vacation and status updates about your new job amounted to bragging — force-feeding Facebook friends information they didn’t ask for. What was once cool was now uncool. Worse yet it started to feel like work. Maybe the burden of constantly constructing immaculate digital profiles of ourselves is tiring. “I find it boring and I don’t really care about knowing all my friends’ details anymore” my fifteen-year-old cousin Neah Bois wrote to me. “I think it’s stupid when people post a lot of pictures about their lives and all that stuff… I go on to talk to family and connect but really I only go on once a week or so.” New apps new identities Teens have turned to sites like Tumblr and apps like Snapchat and Instagram to communicate. “Tumblr is mainly my obsession as of now” says 15-year-old Collin Wisniewski. “It just seems more intimate and its not really a place of bragging but more of a place of sharing.” “Does this sound familiar?” asks Adam Rifkin in a TechCrunch column. “Teenagers amusing images sharing only with trusted friends? In some ways Tumblr is actually Facebook 2.0!” he writes. Some data suggests that Tumblr may have already eclipsed Facebook as the most popular social network among 13-25 year-olds. “[TUMBLR] JUST SEEMS MORE INTIMATE AND ITS NOT REALLY A PLACE OF BRAGGING BUT MORE OF A PLACE OF SHARING.” Part of Tumblr’s success is no doubt due to that fact that it’s a place where you can cultivate two or more identities whereas on Facebook you’re stuck with just one: the real you. “It’s a site where you can find people that are like you and you can feel less alone” Wisniewski said. Tumblr’s simple and binary privacy controls may have also contributed to its success. “As Facebook has become a real-life social network infested with parents co-workers ex-friends and people you barely know” Rifkin writes “Tumblr has become the place where young people express themselves.” Bois concurred. “I’m kind of obsessed. [Tumblr is] the new Facebook almost” she said. On the mobile devices that have become so central to our lives “ephemeral” apps like Snapchat have emerged as a private way for friends to share photos. In the age of the dox — where a sense of online privacy is very sacred being able to communicate without leaving a permanent record is empowering. Whereas photos on Facebook last forever photos on Snapchat typically last about ten seconds. “I would say that this app really is one of my major communicating devices more than really a social network” Wisniewski says. “My sister maintains that Snapchat is up there with Instagram in terms of usage amongst her peers” Miller wrote. Adapt to survive Ultimately the day of the overshare may have passed and bragging online isn’t as fun as it used to be. “I think that kids just don’t care anymore” Bois wrote. “They have gotten over the idea of knowing everybody’s life and everybody knowing their lives!” Fortunately for Facebook it has become adept at reshaping itself whenever a new tech trend emerges like peer-to-peer messaging. “Facebook has been particularly agile about following how people are using it and trying to anticipate what will keep people using it” Portwood-Stacer says. The company has sculpted its messaging platform into the most functional and useful cross-platform communication service which most teens admit that they use and has even added free calling to its Messenger app. Facebook is still on the way up as a pure communication utility. It has also taken steps to decrease the amount of Open Graph “spam” users receive in response to criticism. “I DON’T ACTUALLY THINK FACEBOOK ITSELF IS STALE.” “I don’t actually think Facebook itself is stale” Portwood-Stacer says. “It’s all about changing things up on you when they roll out some new feature… It is more socially stale if that makes sense.” Today it’s just not as cool to post pictures of yourself online no matter which social network you use — unless you’re taking “selfies” ironically of course. “About 40 percent of everyday speech is devoted to telling others about what we feel or think” reported the Wall Street Journal back in May and online that figure could be much larger. While Facebook amplified our ability to share thoughts with others it also takes a hit when people realize the amount they’re sharing through observing others. Mark Zuckerberg’s baby is still a long ways off from the precipitous decline of Myspace but the data and the details gathered from teens show Facebook needs to be nimbler than ever to stay relevant to the next generation.,technology,youth,facebook,sharing,tumblr, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj9202ZuCt1s75lgto1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

This interdisciplinary project conducted by architectural and engineering researchers of both institutes together with students of the faculty and in collaboration with biologists of the University of Tübingen investigates the possible interrelation between biomimetic design strategies and novel processes of robotic production. The research focused on the material and morphological principles of arthropods’ exoskeletons as a source of exploration for a new composite construction paradigm in architecture.  At the core of the project is the development of an innovative robotic fabrication process within the context of the building industry based on filament winding of carbon and glass fibres and the related computational design tools and simulation methods. A key aspect of the project was to transfer the fibrous morphology of the biological role model to fibre-reinforced composite materials the anisotropy of which was integrated from the start into the computer-based design and simulation processes thus leading to new tectonic possibilities in architecture. The integration of the form generation methods the computational simulations and robotic manufacturing specifically allowed the development of a high performance structure: the pavilion requires only a shell thickness of four millimetres of composite laminate while spanning eight metres.  Following a “bottom-up” approach a wide range of different subtypes of invertebrates were initially investigated in regards to the material anisotropy and functional morphology of arthropods. The observed biological principles were analysed and abstracted in order to be subsequently transferred into viable design principles for architectural applications. The exoskeleton of the lobster (Homarus americanus) was analysed in greater detail for its local material differentiation which finally served as the biological role model of the project.  The lobster’s exoskeleton (the cuticle) consists of a soft part the endocuticle and a relatively hard layer the exocuticle. The cuticle is a secretion product in which chitin fibrils are embedded in a protein matrix. The specific differentiation of the position and orientation of the fibres and related material properties respond to specific local requirements. The chitin fibres are incorporated in the matrix by forming individual unidirectional layers. In the areas where a non-directional load transfer is required such individual layers are laminated together in a spiral (helicoidal) arrangement. The resulting isotropic fibre structure allows a uniform load distribution in every direction. On the other hand areas which are subject to directional stress distributions exhibit a unidirectional layer structure displaying an anisotropic fibre assembly which is optimized for a directed load transfer. Due to this local material differentiation the shell creates a highly adapted and efficient structure. The abstracted morphological principles of locally adapted fibre orientation constitute the basis for the computational form generation material design and manufacturing process of the pavilion.  In collaboration with the biologists the fibre orientation fibre arrangement and associated layer thickness and stiffness gradients in the exoskeleton of the lobster were carefully investigated. The high efficiency and functional variation of the cuticle is due to a specific combination of exoskeletal form fibre orientation and matrix. These principles were applied to the design of a robotically fabricated shell structure based on a fibre composite system in which the resin-saturated glass and carbon fibres were continuously laid by a robot resulting in a compounded structure with custom fibre orientation.  In existing fibre placement techniques e.g. in the aero-space industry or advanced sail production the fibres are typically laid on a separately manufactured positive mold. Since the construction of a complete positive formwork is fairly unsuitable for the building industry the project aimed to reduce the positive form to a minimum. As a consequence the fibres were laid on a temporary lightweight linear steel frame with defined anchor points between which the fibres were tensioned. From the straight segments of the prestressed fibres surfaces emerge that result in the characteristic double curved shape of the pavilion. In this way the hyperbolic paraboloid surfaces resulting from the first sequence of glass fibre winding serve as an integral mould for the subsequent carbon and glass fibre layers with their specific structural purposes and load bearing properties. In other words the pavilion itself establishes the positive formwork as part of the robotic fabrication sequence. Moreover during the fabrication process it was possible to place the fibres so that their orientation is optimally aligned with the force flow in the skin of the pavilion. Fibre optic sensors which continuously monitor the stress and strain variations were also integrated in the structure. The project’s concurrent consideration of shell geometry fibre arrangement and fabrication process leads to a novel synthesis of form material structure and performance.  Through this high level of integration the fundamental properties of biological structures were transferred: - Heterogeneity: six different filament winding sequences control the variation of the fibre layering and the fibre orientation of the individual layers at each point of the shell. They are designed to minimize material consumption whilst maximizing the stiffness of the structure resulting in significant material efficiency and a very lightweight structure. - Hierarchy: the glass fibres are mainly used as a spatial partitioning element and serve as the formwork for the following layers whilst the stiffer carbon fibres contribute primarily to the load transfer and the global stiffness of the system. - Function integration: in addition to the structural carbon fibres for the load transfer and the glass fibres for the spatial articulation functional fibres for illumination and structural monitoring can be integrated in the system.  A prerequisite for the design development and realization of the project was a closed digital information chain linking the project’s model finite element simulations material testing and robot control. Form finding material and structural design were directly integrated in the design process whereby the complex interaction of form material structure and fabrication technology could be used as an integral aspect of the biomimetic design methodology. The direct coupling of geometry and finite element simulations into computational models allowed the generation and comparative analysis of numerous variations. In parallel the mechanical properties of the fibre composites determined by material testing were included in the process of form generation and material optimization. The optimization of the fibre and layer arrangement through a gradient-based method allowed the development of a highly efficient structure with minimal use of material.  The robotic fabrication of the research pavilion was performed on-site in a purpose-built weatherproof manufacturing environment by a 6-axis robot coupled with an external seventh axis. Placed on a 2m high pedestal and reaching an overall working span and height of 4m the robot placed the fibres on the temporary steel frame which was actuated in a circular movement by the robotically controlled turntable. As part of the fabrication process the fibres were saturated with resin while running through a resin bath directly prior to the robotic placement. This specific setup made it possible to achieve a structure of approximately 8.0m in diameter and 3.5m height by continuously winding more than 60 kilometres of fibre rovings. The parametric definition of the winding motion paths in relation to the digital geometry model the robotic motion planning including mathematical coupling with the external axis as well as the generation of robot control code itself could be implemented in a custom-developed design and manufacturing integrated environment. After completion of the robotic filament winding process and the subsequent tempering of the fibre-resin composite the temporary steel frame could be disassembled and removed. The remaining extremely thin shell of just 4mm thickness constitutes an automatically fabricated but locally differentiated structure.  The concurrent integration of the biomimetic principles of the lobster’s cuticle and the logics of the newly developed robotic carbon and glass fibre filament winding within the computational design process enable a high level of structural performance and novel tectonic opportunities for architecture. Despite its considerable size and span the semi-transparent skin of the pavilion weighs less than 320kg and reveals the system’s structural logic through the spatial arrangement of the carbon and glass fibres. The synthesis of novel modes of computational and material design digital simulation and robotic fabrication allows both the exploration of a new repertoire of architectural possibilities and the development of extremely lightweight and materially efficient structures.

It’s an amazing experience for artists using the platform as a medium — we hope to see only more of it.” “The one-day event on Saturday March 9 which coincides with Armory Art Week in New York will feature an exhibition and function as a forum for work to be discussed shared liked uploaded and critiqued. “Why is Tumblr a medium that is increasingly being used by artists? What does Tumblr contribute to the creative process? These and many other questions will be explored during the March 9 evening conference that invites artists writers curators art enthusiasts and others to discuss the wondrous world of art on Tumblr. “The Tumblr Art Symposium came about after an important essay published last year by Hyperallergic writer Ben Valentine “Tumblr as Art” started asking questions about Tumblr and what it means for art. Tumblr he wrote “creates an issue: sustained attention on a single work is hard to come by causing a devaluing of authorship.” While creating a “completely new type and scale of engagement for the average viewer.” These are new conditions for art but they are also challenges that artists love. “An Active Dialogue “Among the invited speakers and panels for The World’s First Tumblr Art Symposium are pioneering net artist G. H. Hovagimyan who will discuss Tumblr’s relationship with early net art the duo behind Eco Art Tech (Leila Nadir and Cary Peppermint) who will explore the environmental ecology of Tumblr and social media and curator Christiane Paul who wrote the important book Digital Art….” (via Tumblr Art Symposium | Beyond The Beyond | Wired.com),technology,tumblr,art,people,influencer, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj7gsmKxt91s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

But your average 20-something he is not. Some would describe the 24-year-old as the definitive photographer of hipster culture worldwide. Getting his start as an assistant to Shepard Fairey the young photographer quickly became immersed in the creative worlds of haute couture and club kids. He has met partied with and photographed celebrities. Now he works alongside them and considers many of them his friends. On his website where he sells his photos and clothing he has posted a tribute to DJ AM — with photos of the deejay smiling working and hanging out. And although he’s quiet about the topic of Adam Goldstein he dishes about just about anything else — except how much he earns from taking photographs of other people. Hunter chatted with us about his dream life what he’s wearing and what’s next:    When’s your birthday? July 21 1985 Your sign?I’m on the cusp but I’m a Cancer. You’re very young and yet you’ve achieved a lot. Do you already feel as if you’ve seen and done it all?No way. I’m just beginning. I’ve got so many other cool things I’m trying and working on. I’m really excited about life.Can you talk about those cool things you’re working on?One is that I’m working with RVCA [the surf and skateboard line] and we’re doing a collection with pieces of clothing that I designed. What kind of clothes? Men’s? Women’s?Fun button-ups crazy jeans. It’s good for everyone. It’s wild and crazy like me. Speaking of clothes it’s been said that you dress badly and that you will wear absolutely anything. Why is that?I’m so aware of fashion and trends. I’ve photographed New York Fashion Week Paris Fashion Week and other fashion-type things. I digest all that and I just do whatever I want. Is there anything you wouldn’t wear?No. I find irony in everything. I’ve worn Ed Hardy on occasion. It was my Halloween costume. I wear Crocs out. I get made fun of for that. What are you wearing right now?Right now I’m about to go to Hurricane Harbor or Raging Waters — whichever one has better coupons. So I’m getting my beach look on. I’m pretty sure you are doing fairly well financially. You still use coupons?I love coupons. What are your dreams?To continue to be creative and sort of push the boundaries. This whole thing has been ridiculous for me. I got into meetings with big corporate companies and I’m on the agenda as “Cobra Snake.” It’s crazy. Cory Kennedy. You helped her get her start. What made her stand out among models/subjects?She has amazing personal style — mixing things you would never think could work and she makes them look great. Along with her carefree personality. She is a very magical person. And what about your beginnings. How did you get started in your business?I was working for Shepard Fairey for a couple of years as his assistant. He was introducing me to a lot of cool parties and art events. Events where Bjork would be deejaying and things like that. I recognized that this is special so I would take pictures. People would say things to me like “Hey I didn’t bring my digital camera tonight. Can you e-mail me some pictures you took?” So I would e-mail the photos. Eventually I set up a website called Polaroid Scene. What kind of camera do you use?I never talk about my camera. Everyone has been trying to rip me off. Do you have a work routine? Things you do to get yourself ready?It’s hard because I’m preparing myself for many different climates and I never know what I’m getting myself into. I’ll do a keys wallet cellphone check. Camera extra batteries. Favorite drink?Beer. Do you have a favorite night club?Not really. Cinespace in Hollywood. Talk about club culture. How has it changed since you’ve been photographing it?It continues to evolve. Kids are finding the same music off blogs. Kids in Australia can listen to the same music they do here in L.A. because of the Internet. It’s a crazy international party scene. You’re from L.A. Like many photographers and other creative artists did you ever do the bi-coastal thing splitting time between here and New York?Yeah I shared an apartment with Steve Aoki in New York for about two years. For a while I focused a lot of energy on building a fan base in New York. Now it’s more international cities. You’re all over the world now. What’s your favorite city?I like Sydney. I like Paris. I like Tokyo. It’s so hard for me to pick. I’ve gone to Argentina with Toms Shoes and did a shoe drop. Giving shoes to those who don’t have them. It’s not always about partying. Do you photograph bat mitzvahs and bar mitzvahs?Yes. Also weddings and birthday parties and Sweet 16s. How many assistants do you have? I have an amazing team of about 10 people that help me with everything. From running the Cobra Shop my online store to helping with photo shoots art shows and castings. We also go on team hikes and bike rides. ,fashion,technology,youth,hipster, , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj6w5pxfUM1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5990b61970c-320wi,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a5422d02970b-320wi, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 
44616598769,2013-03-05 13:21:58 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/44616598769/tenth-grade-tech-trends,text,Tenth Grade Tech Trends,Instagram Looking at her Instagram feed I noticed that the vast majority of photos were of people – not beautiful views objects or experiences. This is instark contrast to what the people I follow on Instagram take photos of and very analogous to the photos that appear in my Facebook Newsfeed.  Facebook She mentioned that she tries to visit Facebook as infrequently as possible. “It’s addicting” she bemoaned “you end up getting lost in it and I don’t like that.” I found this perspective interesting. Facebook is clearly doing a good job delivering relevant content yet its users (at least this one) feel poorly when they use the service. Related she mentioned that she only visits Facebook after her Instagram Feed updates have been exhausted.  Instant Message While much of my childhood was spent instant messaging on AIM and then Facebook Chat my sister says she and her friends rarely IM with each other. “When you go on Facebook Chat the people you don’t want to talk to are always the ones who immediately chat with you.” Most of my sister’s friends’ post-school communication takes place on iOS apps such as iMessage and Snapchat. Though she did say that they use Facebook Message fairly often as a way to asynchronously send each other notes (in other words email for adolescents)…My sister couldn’t even remember her Gmail password when I recently sent her something that’s how infrequently she uses email right now. That’s bound to change soon.  Snapchat My sister maintains that Snapchat is up there with Instagram in terms of usage amongst her peers. Her exemplary use case was a moment that she captured in the airport of a funny looking man who was snoozing in an awkward position. It’s the type of thing that you want to share with somebody but it’s insignificance would make it awkward in a text or status update. “It’s a way to connect with friends when you don’t really have anything to say.” Or in my words if traditional messaging is functional — communicating for a purpose; “What time do you want to meet for the movie?” — Snapchat is the opposite whatever that is.  Tumblr Surprisingly I found my sister’s insights on Tumblr most interesting. First off she described Tumblr as a photo service: “It’s photos only.” I mean she knew that it supported text posts — after I cried “You know it’s a blogging platform right?!” — but couldn’t remember a time when she saw anything but a photo in her Dashboard. Second despite knowing many active Tumblr users she said she didn’t know anyone who actually posted on the service. Rather she said the majority of her friends merely consumed content with a tiny minority reblogging stuff that reflected who they wanted to be (more on that later). Third she said most of her friends stopped using the service once they reached high school: “Tumblr is mostly middle schoolers. Especially hipsters. They just reblog stuff.” (Note: we’re from Santa Monica and my sister would be considered “hipster” by Northeast standards.) Finally whereas Instagram is a place you follow “celebrities and bands” she mentioned that on Tumblr her friends follow people who they aspire to be. Cobra Snake was her quintessential example of the type of Tumblr user that is idolized on the service. These “idols” are the ones who post most of the content (photos) on Tumblr content that is then reblogged by kids who aspire to be what the photos represent. Twitter She had almost nothing to say about Twitter because she didn’t know anyone in high school that used it. “Nobody uses it. I know you love it but I don’t get it. I mean I guess a a few kids use it but they’re all the ones who won’t shut up in class who always think they have something important to say.” (Note: that was me in high school unfortunately.) For me Twitter is predominantly a link discovery service — admittedly that is a simplified view but it’s helpful for these purposes — so I followed-up on her Twitter comments by asking where she discovers links. “What do you mean?” She couldn’t even understand what I was asking. I rephrased the question: “What links do you read? What sites do they come from? What blogs?” I don’t read links. I don’t read blogs. I don’t know. You mean like funny videos on Facebook? Sometimes people post funny links there. But I’m not really interested in anything yet like you are. She didn’t know what BuzzFeed was and doesn’t visit fashion blogs! (Of course the older brother thinks that would be a given.) I was floored., ,technology,social media,youth,sharing, , , , , , , , , , , ,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

With their help I surveyed 1038 people in two groups — those aged 13-18 (546 responses) and 19-25 (492 responses) and asked which services they used regularly (defined by several hours per week or more multiple answers OK). Survata cofounder Aaron Wenger noted: “Usage levels were higher among 13-18yr olds than 19-25yr olds for every social network.  The biggest differences were for Snapchat (13% for 13-18yr olds vs 4% for 19-25yr olds) and Instagram (21% vs 11%).”  This confirms Josh’s observation that there is some significant usage among the younger generation — particularly among high-school age teenagers. Whether they continue to use it as they mature get email addresses and enter the workforce will be an interesting thing to watch.  It turns out Facebook’s doing just fine with the kids these days — in fact slightly more of the younger demographic reported using it regularly. But perhaps most impressive was Tumblr topping the list at #1 with 59% of respondents saying they used it regularly. Survata showed my question as a content survey-wall to people throughout the United States — respondents were slightly female skewed (60% vs. 40% dudes) — and they appeared on blogs and content providers like Hyperink. Perhaps the most heartening observation from the Snapchat/Instagram phenomenon is that new social behaviors can and will happen.,technology,social media,data,sharing,youth,instagram,snapchat,tumblr,twitter,facebook, , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj6veqZnPJ1s75lgto1_1280.png, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

If you guessed Facebook you are way behind the eight-ball because Tumblr now enjoys more regular visits from the youth of America… Tumblr actually became huge because it is the anti-blog. What is the No. 1 reason that people quit blogging? Because they can’t find and develop an audience. This has been true of every blogging platform ever made. Conversely blogs that do find an audience tend to keep adding that type of content. This simple philosophy boils down to the equation: Mo’ pageviews = mo’ pages. But Tumblr does not conform to this calculus and the reason is that a large percentage of Tumblr users actually don’t WANT an audience. They do not want to be found except by a few close friends who they explicitly share one of their tumblogs with. Therefore Tumblr’s notoriously weak search functionality is A-OK with most of its user base. Tumblr provides its users with the oldest privacy-control strategy on the Internet: security through obscurity and multiple pseudonymity. Its users prefer a coarse-grained scheme they can easily understand over a sophisticated fine-grained privacy control — such as Facebook provides — that requires a lot of time and patience. To quote Sweet Brown Ain’t nobody got time for that. Tumblr proves that the issue is less about public vs. private and more about whether you are findable and identifiable by people who actually know you in real life… the fact that Tumblr offers full animated gif support is crucial as a differentiator from the static environs of Facebook Twitter Instagram and even Pinterest. Ten seconds of reaction shot — or sex act — make a big difference in expressive power. Also gifs are far easier to view on mobile devices than video and so far the big content owners have made little effort to stamp them out via DMCA.  Does this sound familar? Teenagers amusing images sharing only with trusted friends? In some ways Tumblr is actually Facebook 2.0! As Facebook has become a real-life social network infested with parents co-workers ex-friends and people you barely know Tumblr has become the place where young people express themselves and their ACTUAL INTERESTS with their ACTUAL FRIENDS.  And Tumblr is growing — it’s now one of the top 10 websites in the United States with 20 billion pageviews a month. The tremendous user engagement is enabling the company to quietly and discreetly build a powerful Interest Graph of things its users actually like and want to share. Tumblr still has a long road ahead with monetization but the Interest Graph will be crucial to making sure anything Tumblr does is targeted and relevant to its users. It’s important to note that Tumblr is not replacing Facebook; it’s merely siphoning off some authentic liking and sharing especially among young Americans. Facebook needs to exist because it’s holding down the Mom siblings and lame friends part of a person’s social life — the “public-private” life if you will. As long as Mom sees you on Facebook occasionally she isn’t going to think to look for you on another site… which paradoxically frees young users to act out on a stage that seems more private to them despite being on the open web., ,technology,tumblr,facebook,privacy,sharing,youth,teenagers, , , , , , , , ,none,none,none, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

44557554728,2013-03-04 20:02:00 GMT,http://ifthisthenth-ey.tumblr.com/post/44557554728/netflix-data-and-puppets-andrew-leonard-for-salon,photo, , ,Netflix data and puppets Andrew Leonard for Salon fears what might come of the creative process if movies are based on algorithms and data and that we might turn into puppets.  For years Netflix has been analyzing what we watched last night to suggest movies or TV shows that we might like to watch tomorrow. Now it is using the same formula to prefabricate its own programming to fit what it thinks we will like. Isn’t the inevitable result of this that the creative impulse gets channeled into a pre-built canal?  Because tastes never change? We don’t have any choice but to watch what is handed to us? Will creators stop making things that go against the norm? Leonard concludes with us stuck in a trance in front of our televisions.  The companies that figure out how to generate intelligence from that data will know more about us than we know ourselves and will be able to craft techniques that push us toward where they want us to go rather than where we would go by ourselves if left to our own devices. I’m guessing this will be good for Netflix’s bottom line but at what point do we go from being happy subscribers to mindless puppets?  Again the assumption is that we have no say in the matter. But when a company or service suggests that we buy or watch something we don’t have to follow. Netflix in particular thrives by providing a service that shows us what we think we might want to watch from a selection of thousands of options. Part of that algorithm depends on our own movie ratings and preferences. If Netflix offers poor suggestions you can leave the service. Yeah. You can stop paying 8 bucks a month. Let’s turn it around. What if Netflix analyzed viewing data not to offer their best viewing suggestions or to make shows and movies that people like but to expand people’s viewing windows? Let’s say that the data shows that you watch a lot of “witty critically acclaimed comedies” so Netflix suggests you watch more “romantic dramas” to make you more well-rounded. Are you a mindless puppet if you take the suggestion even if you end up hating the movie? Are you a mindless puppet if you ignore the suggestion and continue watching what you know you like? From the production perspective it makes sense to try to make something a lot of people like. From the consumer perspective we still get to decide what we want to spend our money on. It’s good to be concerned about how companies use personal data. Data privacy ownership and ethics are important issues but it shouldn’t mean a fear of all things data. http://bit.ly/15t22dU,FlowingData,data,Nathan Yau,tv,tech, , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj5b1xKiHp1s75lgto2_r1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WDPkTL, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

It was all about the coats. For Fall 2013 Chloé’s Clare Waight Keller channeled a school girl in the most rebellious sense. In her show notes the list of inspirations read “night buses independent spirit bare legs dorm rooms…tough girls” and so on. The references were fairly literal: Duffle coats a red and black pinafore and plenty of white-collar shirts. This girl was most certainly taking utility dressing into her own hands—a good thing obviously. But the coats… the coats were on another level.

A new communication standard developed by Microchip Technology allows secure bi-directional data transmission through a human body. At this stage the technology uses a small device similar in size to a garage door opener which the user carries close to their body for example in a pocket. It then sits ready to transmit data through the body when the user touches a base unit which could for example be hooked up to a door handle. A secure key transmitted from the device in the users pocket and through their body into the door handle could then unlock the door. One day it could be easy to see the technology built into a smartphone carried in a users pocket allowing a wireless link from the phone to a headset or for a file or virtual business card to be transmitted when shaking hands.,technology, , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj1pqrpMSM1qft3eko1_500.jpg, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

Citing the notoriously jolie-laide actress Béatrice Dalle as an inspiration Guillaume steered his muse slightly to the left to fascinating effect. The Carven building blocks were absolutely there: flirty skirts casual party dresses great solid coats. But Dalle’s Lolita influence was everywhere from the slouchy bathrobe styling to the undressed allure of a pink slip dress paired with opera-length gloves. References aside Carven continues to get the proportions just right: Guillaume knows that girls like their sweaters cropped and their skirts high-waisted. Coming soon to a stylish parking lot near you.

Margiela obvi) the designer-less brand has the attention of the masses if not mass appeal. But yesterday’s fall collection had a bit of that too.

You’ll find places where water has penetrated the structure where it should not have. Identifying mold and moisture is a much easier task with the Mµ Thermal Imager. Mµ Optics is currently seeking financial support on crowsourced-funding website Indiegogo. The iPhone attachment may offer steep competition to the existing thermal imaging cameras that range in prices from $2000 to $22000 according to Mµ Optics. The Mµ Thermal Imager is currently offered for $125 and $150 to early adopters with a final price goal of less than $200 if they are able to stock the product in the big box stores.  http://bit.ly/WzfWWb,Archinect,tech, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj1rzicyqM1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:13w0hxU, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

I’m all talked out about the shows for now as all my show chat is on Dazed but one immediate thing to bring to attention came about at the Maison Martin Margiela show.  For those of you with short hair this may not excite you so much so apologies if I sound like a crazed overenthusiastic loon.  I thought we had seen everything that’s physically possible in the technical constuction of a garment.  I thought nothing new could be termed.  However can we take a second to ponder these inbuilt hair straps that were worked into every jacket shirt coat dress and top at the MMM show today.  Have we seen these done before?  If not why haven’t they been done before?  This solves a lot of the problems that afflicts the I-don’t-know-what-to-do-with-my-hair tribe which I’m an enthused member of.  No product pins clips and hairbands required.  Just shove the mane into place in its prime located hair strap.   If any of you do find prior examples of this simple but very VERY nifty design detailing please do let me know.  To my mind I can’t recall this being used.  It seems to have been a solution that stemmed from women tucking their long hair into a poloneck (thanks Celine) or wearing it loose and entirely obscured by a giant upturned coat collar.  Therefore I’d say Maison Martin Margiela have a fairly good case to apply for a design patent if they are deemed to be the one and only inventors of the hair-strap to stop everyone else getting their knock-off mitts on this feature.  I urgently needed to hone in on this bit of detailing that isn’t even visible from the frontview of catwalk images.  It feels strange that such a practical tailored and somewhat insignifcant device would come from MMM but yet at the same time the height of Margiela’s prowess was when high-concept married up with pragmatic reality.  This was definitely one of those instances.                 http://bit.ly/YQvsR0,Style Bubble,fashion, , , , , , , , , , , , , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:tumblr_mj1rzcmz1o1s75lgto1_1280.jpg, , ,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvtV8,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvtVa,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsAk,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsAm,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsAo,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsAq,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WxhCiW,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WxhCzc,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsAC,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvubC,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvubE,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:YQvsQW,Users:troytherrien:Insync:info@th-ey.co:GIT:therrienbarley.com:util:node:tumblr-air:photos:WxhCzi, , , , , , ,
